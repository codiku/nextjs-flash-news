        "description": "US Navy officer Lt. Ridge Alkonis, who was jailed in Japan for negligent driving that resulted in the death of two people, has been booked into a federal prison in Los Angeles following his transfer to the US.",
        "content": "US Navy officer Lt. Ridge Alkonis, who was jailed in for negligent driving that resulted in the death of two people, has been booked into a federal prison in Los Angeles following his transfer to the US, according to a family spokesperson and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. “We can confirm Ridge Alkonis is in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) Los Angeles,” a BOP spokesperson told CNN. A family spokesperson, Jonathan Franks, said in a statement that “Lt. Alkonis is now housed in a notorious federal lockup in Los Angeles, and BOP tells us it will take up to 90 days to approve Brittany and the kids to visit him. We believe the BOP can and should release Ridge immediately – it is outrageous he is spending the night in jail.” The BOP spokesperson said the bureau had nothing to add when asked by CNN when Alkonis’ family might be able to visit him. Earlier Thursday, the Alkonis family said in a statement that they were “encouraged” by the transfer. “After 507 days, Lt. Ridge Alkonis is on his way home to the United States. We are encouraged by Ridge’s transfer back to the United States but cannot celebrate until Ridge has been reunited with his family,” the statement said. Two US officials confirmed earlier in the day that Alkonis was in US custody. One of those officials told CNN that he was remanded to US custody after direct engagement by Vice President Kamala Harris and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, and was being brought back to the US under an international prisoner convention that allows individuals to serve the remainder of their confinement in their home country. When Alkonis arrives back in the US, the official said, “he will go before an entity called the US parole commission within the Department of Justice, which will consider his case and make a determination about further confinement.” According to a Department of Justice official, the parole commission process could take several months. They will look at Alkonis’ prison sentence in Japan and determine what would have been done in the US, and then determine what his remaining punishment would be. He could end up in home custody, this official said. “The Biden administration signaled to the Parole Commission that if they want to understand the complexity of the diplomacy, his military record, the fact that he was a model prisoner or anything else, we are available to do that as long as the Commission deems it appropriate,” they said. The Department of Justice declined to comment. Alkonis, who was stationed in Japan, was sentenced to three years in a Japanese prison in October 2021 for negligent driving resulting in the death of two people and injuries to a third person in May 2021. He said he suffered from acute mountain sickness as he was driving with his family from Mount Fuji, which caused him to lose consciousness. That argument was rejected by the court. His appeal was denied in July 2022. Alkonis’ family argued he was ill, not negligent, and therefore committed no crime. They have also noted that they offered the victims’ families over $1 million in restitution, as is customary in Japan. The Alkonis family had claimed that there have been violations of the status of forces agreement between the United States and Japan during the proceedings of the case. Related Articles The family pushed for him to be transferred back to the US under the Council of Europe (COE) Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, which would allow him to serve out his sentence there. Under the terms of the treaty, which Japan joined in 2003, “The prisoner, the Government of Japan and the U.S. government must all agree to the transfer,” according to the “Transfers can take 2 years or longer from the time the process begins,” it notes. Twenty Republican senators wrote to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in August asking the Japanese government to consider expelling Alkonis as they made the case that the “full nature” of the situation had not been taken into consideration. They also noted that a Navy investigation concluded that Alkonis lost consciousness because of acute mountain sickness. The family said they appreciated “the efforts of the U.S. Government to effect this transfer and are glad that an impartial set of judiciary eyes will review his case for the first time.” “We trust that the DOJ will urgently wish to end this travesty of justice by immediately releasing Ridge, and we look forward to Ridge enjoying the holidays at home with his wife and children.” CNN’s Evan Perez contributed to this report.

        "content": "Efforts to eradicate female genital mutilation in Kenya have suffered a setback after a police officer was killed in a confrontation with a gang of youths. Activists and local leaders condemned the murder, calling it a backward step in the fight to eradicate the practice in the country. Police in Elgeyo Marakwet county, in the Rift Valley region, had taken a group of girls who had been forced to undergo the illegal procedure to hospital when a mob of young men stormed a police station and stoned Cpl Mushote Boma to death. “Angry youth raided the police post in a bid to get the girls, who had been rescued by police after they were genitally mutilated, where they overpowered the officer who was on duty and stoned him to death before burning his body using a mattress,” reported the government-owned Kenya news agency . The six girls are recuperating at a local hospital, according to county police commander, Peter Mulinge. Female genital mutilation, or “the cut”, remains illegal in Kenya but is still being practised in some places, usually during school holidays , by women using crude methods and tools. There have been cases of activists being attacked by those carrying out FGM, but assaults on law enforcement officers are rare. “It is shocking and disheartening that in the 21st century we can kill a police officer rescuing girls undergoing the inhumane act,” said Tony Mwebia, founder and executive director of the not-for-profit Men End FGM Foundation that aims to rally men and boys against FGM and child marriages. “Were these men who killed the policeman aware of why they were protecting the backward culture? Do they have any idea of the harm caused by the cut?” Mwebia, whose organisation has since trained nearly 500 male champions in counties where FGM exists, says men cringe when they are shown videos of the cut, a rite they traditionally believe is undertaken for their benefit. “They are told the cut makes women more mature and avoid promiscuity. They are also told that they will lose any respect within the community by marrying an uncut woman. That is why they will kill anyone, including a policeman, who interferes with the cut,” Mwebia said. Mwebia was attacked by another group of men in Kuria in December 2016 after he and a colleague were suspected of filming a street parade of girls undergoing the cut. A local administrator, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, said the attack on law enforcement officers will embolden those performing the cut as they will see the government as weak and unable to protect its own. “Killing a police officer in the name of FGM worries me,” he said. “We know FGM is illegal in Kenya but just enforcing the law without adequate public sensitisation against the vice will have little success. There must be a robust conversation with local people if we are to stem the FGM tide in the region.” According to The Nation newspaper , about 70 girls were rescued by the police, with Viola Cherono, a human rights activist from the region, reporting that as many as 500 girls had been assembling in the forest to undergo the practice. ‘Every chemist has a backroom’: the rise of secret FGM in Kenya Read more “Girls are being cut every day in the Endo and Embobut wards. The people in Embobut are very wild and if you are an activist or the police, they will come and get you,” she told the paper. Bernadette Loloju, chief executive officer of the Anti-FGM Board in Kenya, said the killing was “an isolated incident beyond human thinking”, but that it should not be used to gauge the extent of the fight against the practice. “Cases of FGM have come down in communities that were strongly for the cut, mainly because girls have come out to say no,” said Loloju. “Although women are the perpetrators of the cut, we continue to engage the elders who are the cultural gatekeepers. These are the men who are shocked when they see videos of how FGM is done.” Mwebia said the war against FGM will only be won if “we don’t waste resources in conferences but change our strategies”. “There is political goodwill, right from the country’s top leadership. The silence from men will be the biggest barrier.”",

        "description": "Advocates say the separations stem from the federal government's ongoing practice of releasing high volumes of migrants to street locations around San Diego County without coordinated reception plans.",
        "content": "Nearly 1,100 migrant families have been separated while being processed at the U.S.-Mexico border near San Diego since September, immigrant advocacy groups said in a letter sent Thursday to the Department of Homeland Security that seeks an investigation into the matter. The separations stem from U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s ongoing practice of releasing high volumes of migrants to street locations around San Diego County without coordinated reception plans, according to the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy and three other groups that signed the letter. As migrant arrivals at the California-Mexico border have increased, Customs and Border Protection has turned to street releases and holding migrants between border walls to reduce the number of people in its short-term facilities. According to the letter, immigration law group Al Otro Lado documented 1,081 family separations among the hundreds of migrants it serves each day at a border welcome center in San Diego, where it provides legal aid and translation services. Of that total, there were almost 400 separations of spouses and about 200 separations of adult children from the parents they were traveling with, including 43 children between age 18 and 21. Separations of those in other family relationships, such as adult siblings, cousins and common-law partners, make up the remainder of the total. In at least 39 cases, families remained separated after one or more members were transferred to long-term immigrant detention facilities. In at least two cases, one family member was deported while the others remain in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. “The trauma families experience during the periods of separation is compounded by CBP’s lack of communication and the near-total opacity of their practices,” states the letter to the Department of Homeland Security’s office of civil rights and civil liberties, which was also signed by the ACLU Foundation of San Diego and Imperial Counties, and Jewish Family Service of San Diego. To prevent further separations, the organizations are asking Homeland Security to broaden the definition of a family group under agency practice to include parents with adult children, couples without marriage certificates, adult siblings and extended family members. The groups are also asking that Homeland Security agents document all relationships among family groups and ensure families are released together, or to communicate the whereabouts of any family members that aren’t released at the same time. The letter comes after a federal judge in San Diego approved a court settlement last week that bars widespread separations of parents from their underage children at the U.S.-Mexico border for the next eight years. The settlement stems from a 2018 ACLU lawsuit over the separations, including those that took place under the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy that led to the prosecutions of migrant parents who crossed the border without authorization. The settlement doesn’t affect family separations like those documented by Al Otro Lado, which the group believes are undercounted. An April 20 Customs and Border Protection memo obtained by The Times, which offers guidance on processing family groups, states that Homeland Security is “committed to protecting the unity of families encountered at the border to the extent legally and operationally feasible.” The guidance included in the memo pertains to parents or guardians with unmarried adult children up to age 25, grandparents with unmarried adult grandchildren up to age 25 and spouses and unmarried adult siblings up to age 25. Agents are required under the guidance to consider any verifiable documentation acknowledging such relationships and to link those individuals as a family group, with the goal of processing them out of custody together. “If the guidance truly is in furtherance of CBP’s stated commitment to maintaining unity of families, then in practice it should be implemented in a way that allows for families to report and have documented their relationships in accordance with the realities of people who are forced to flee their countries,” said Monika Langarica, an attorney with the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at UCLA. Most separated families said they had informed Customs and Border Protection that they were traveling in a family group, according to the letter, but families were rarely told they would be separated or how to locate their relatives. In October, Customs and Border Protection detained nearly 30,000 migrants near San Diego, up from nearly 18,000 in October 2022, according to agency figures. Meghan Zavala, data and policy analyst for Al Otro Lado, said these kinds of separations aren’t unique to San Diego. But Priscilla Orta, a supervising attorney at Brownsville, Texas-based Lawyers for Good Government, which provides legal aid to migrants, said separations aren’t common in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, noting that Customs and Border Protection drops people off at designated locations. Few migrants stay overnight because even if family members are processed separately, there is little delay before they reunite at a welcome center. Spouses are often processed together, she said. “If you came here you’d have absolutely no idea that thousands of people were processed daily,” Orta said. “There’s zero chaos.” Just under half of the families recently separated at the border near San Diego are from Colombia, with smaller numbers from China, Brazil, Afghanistan and Peru, according to Al Otro Lado. Some separations have lasted hours or days, while others documented by the organization have lasted more than a month. Separations involving families who speak languages other than Spanish are particularly difficult, causing advocates to scramble to find interpreters, Zavala said. Some families spend days in crowded San Diego shelters waiting to see whether their relatives will be released, she said. “Our organization along with others continue to be very strained in our capacity and yet are given all these additional hurdles,” Zavala said. “We try to do our best to get information for these families who are quite desperate to know where the person they were traveling with is now being held.” In one case documented by Al Otro Lado, a husband and wife from Colombia were taken into Border Patrol custody in September. The husband was released just across the border from Tijuana in San Diego’s San Ysidro district without his wife, who had been transferred to a detention facility in Louisiana and was deported before she could speak with a local attorney. In another case, a husband and wife were separated during Customs and Border Protection processing. The husband was released without his wife at the San Ysidro Transit Center and returned to the center for weeks, hoping to find her. He later learned she had been transferred to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Texas, where she experienced medical complications. They were separated for 49 days. Julieta, 38, who asked that only her first name be used out of fear for her safety, told The Times she arrived in Tijuana from Colombia with her 19-year-old son. She said they turned themselves over to border agents on Nov. 22. Two days later, she was led to a bus and dropped off at a shelter, with no idea as to her son’s whereabouts. Five days after that, Julieta’s son was dropped off at the same shelter and they reunited. She said she knew they would be detained at the border, but didn’t anticipate that they would be separated. “It’s hell,” she said. “Not knowing if your son is safe, if he is alive, if something happened to him. All you can do is pray to God.”",

        "description": "An ancient Christian minority in northern Israel, including some who fled from Lebanon decades ago, watch nervously as Israel-Hezbollah tensions rise.",
        "content": "Birds swoop across a valley separating Lebanon and Israel as olive and pomegranate trees rustle in the wind. The flash of light from an opposing hillside looks small from a distance — until a boom cracks across the landscape, announcing another Hezbollah rocket launched toward Israel. Minutes later, more explosions peal through the air, as the Israeli military responds to the source of the fire. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza Strip, hostilities have spread north to these hills, where Lebanon-based Hezbollah fighters have launched hundreds of missiles toward Israeli border communities, and Israeli forces have shelled targets to the north. “This is happening every day,” said Shadi Khaloul, a Christian Aramaean activist, as he stands in a pastoral orchard in the northern Israeli town of Jish. Aramaeans are a community of native Christians who trace their lineage to the time of Jesus. Khaloul has been instrumental in reviving spoken Aramaic, believed to be the language of Jesus and one used in portions of the Bible. Like many Aramaeans in Israel, Khaloul has distant family in Lebanon. “I am worried both for my Christian community here in Israel, and for our brothers across the border,” he said, looking over the valley toward the southern Lebanese village of Maroun el Ras. For Maryam Younnes, the conflict is wrenchingly personal. She was born in a small, rural Lebanese village called Debel. Her father was a commander in the Christian-dominated militia South Lebanon Army, which cooperated with the Israeli army during Israel’s 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon. Many in Lebanon viewed members of the SLA as traitors and collaborators for fighting alongside Israel and against Hezbollah. Human rights groups accused the SLA of systematic torture and abuse of Lebanese prisoners at a facility it controlled. When Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, the SLA collapsed and many members and their relatives fled to Israel. Younnes and her family hoped to stay only a few days, until hostilities calmed down. Twenty-three years later, her family is still there. The SLA members and their families were eventually offered and accepted full Israeli citizenship. She said she has been completely cut off from her extended family in Lebanon, with no communication since they left. “The fact that my family is on the other side of the border, it’s not easy, because I know that they will get hurt if a broader war will happen,” Younnes said. “The southern Lebanese never wanted this war .... And then when the war is over, we are the ones who pay the price.” Younnes said the villagers in southern Lebanon — many of whom are Christians — have little choice when Hezbollah militants set up military infrastructure, including rocket launchers, on their property, which puts them at risk for retaliation from Israel. She blames Iran-backed Hezbollah — the militant group and Islamist political party with representatives in Lebanon’s government — for forcing her to stay in Israel. “For me, and for many Lebanese, Hezbollah is occupying Lebanon.” Of the roughly 7,000 SLA members and their families who came to Israel, about 3,000 remain, Younnes said. The others resettled in third countries or went back to Lebanon. Returning SLA officials faced prison sentences, though many family members were not prosecuted. They have struggled to reintegrate into Lebanese society. In October, the Israeli government directed citizens living within 2½ miles of the Lebanese border to evacuate, including more than 30 towns and the city of Kiryat Shmona. At least 63,000 residents from the north are living in temporary accommodations in the center of the country, funded by the government at least until the end of the year. Nearly 70,000 additional Israelis were evacuated from their homes near the Gaza border. Both Younnes and Khaloul live outside the evacuation zones and have stayed put. But the booms from the exchanges of fire shake their homes, providing a constant reminder of the threats in the north, even though the fighting in the south in Gaza captures most of the daily headlines. Israel’s Iron Dome air-defense system intercepts most missiles from Lebanon, though they have killed 10 people in Israel in the last two months. In Lebanon, at least 100 civilians and Hezbollah militants have died due to Israeli artillery fire, according to media reports. Khaloul said that people in northern Israel fear that Hezbollah will carry out a similar strike to the one on Oct. 7, when Hamas militants in Gaza burst through the border fence and attacked Israeli communities, army bases and a music festival, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza. “If the [Hezbollah] terrorists will stay on the border with no solution, a lot of people will not return in the border line communities,” he said. In Israel, the Aramaean Christian minority is concentrated in the north, in isolated, rural communities that often do not have adequate shelters from rocket fire. About 3,000 South Lebanon Army soldiers and their families live in Israel, many of whom are Aramaean Christians as well. They live mostly clustered along the northern towns, “as close to Lebanon as possible,” Younnes said. The Aramaean Christian community numbers just 15,000 in Israel; there are thought to be more than a million Aramaean Christians in Lebanon, and more than 15 million worldwide. Aramaeans such as Younnes and Khaloul struggle to find their place in the complex tapestry of identities that make up northern Israel. Younnes and Khaloul speak Arabic, but do not identify as Arab Israelis. Khaloul led a long legal battle to recognize the community as a distinct official minority group, and in 2014 his son became the first to receive an Israeli identity card listing him as “Aramaean.” Still, many don’t feel fully accepted by the Jewish majority, despite speaking Hebrew and often attending Jewish schools. “Minorities like the native Christians and Druze, especially Aramaic-speaking Christians ... have no one that can protect them,” Khaloul said. To foster greater acceptance in Israel, he has advocated for members of his community to serve in the Israeli army. Khaloul, who works at the Alma Research and Education Center think tank, helped start a preparatory program that brings together young Christians and Jews for a year of study and leadership training ahead of their conscription into the military. Serving in the army helps his community integrate into Israeli society and connect them with better economic and educational opportunities, Khaloul said. Many worry that the tit-for-tat hostilities on the northern front will expand into a major regional war, roping in Iran, Syria, Lebanon and possibly the U.S. and other international powers. “People are asking me all the time if we will be in a wider war, and what we’re saying is that right now we are below the threshold of war,” said Orna Mizrahi, a researcher with the Israel-based Institute for National Security Studies who served for 12 years with the National Security Council of the prime minister’s office. So far, Hezbollah is showing its presence with rockets aimed at targets very close to the border, but not utilizing the organization’s full arsenal by sending missiles deeper into Israel. Hezbollah is believed to have an arsenal of at least 150,000 rockets with high-precision capabilities that can target the entirety of Israel. During Israel’s weeklong cease-fire with Hamas in November, when 110 hostages were freed, Hezbollah mostly honored the truce, renewing rocket attacks only after the deal collapsed. “Neither Hezbollah nor Iran are interested in a wider war,” Mizrahi said. For its part, the Israeli army is “ready at any moment to go on the offensive in the north,” Israeli army chief of staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said during a Dec. 5 news conference. Halevi added that Israel was exploring both diplomatic and military options to deal with the Hezbollah threat. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah boasted in a November speech that its attacks in the north have forced Israel to divert a large amount of its army, navy, and air force resources away from Gaza, which has helped the Palestinians there. The group has also sought to pressure the international community into intervening in the Gaza conflict by demonstrating how violence could spread into a regional war. Both Mizrahi and Khaloul said that for Israelis to regain their sense of security in the north, Hezbollah fighters must be pushed back from their footholds along the border, creating a buffer zone controlled by United Nations forces and the Lebanese army. Evacuated families from the north have railed against the Israeli government, fearful they will be forced to return to a reality where they are living just a couple of miles from a militant group that is better funded, better organized and better armed than Hamas. Mizrahi cited the Litani River, whose western branch runs parallel to the border about 13 miles north, as a psychological boundary for Israelis. If Hezbollah were contained north of the Litani River, that would restore some feeling of safety for Israelis, she said. This is also the boundary that was agreed upon in United Nations Resolution 1701 , which helped end the 2006 war between Israel and Lebanon. But Resolution 1701 has been mostly ignored as Hezbollah has crept closer to the border in recent years. Militants now operate so close to the border that Israelis can see them with their bare eyes. Hezbollah “is just one mile from our homes, maybe two miles from our homes,” Khaloul said. “We don’t need another Oct. 7 to happen here.” Lidman is a special correspondent.

        "content": "Donald Trump’s potential 2024 bid sets the stage for a heated battle against President Joe Biden, barring any legal hiccups. Biden’s global encounters have led many to implore him to block Trump’s return to power. During a Philadelphia fundraiser, the 81-year-old mentioned leaders from various nations fervently urging him against Trump’s victory. PoliticalFlare states, Surging polls favour Trump for the GOP nomination, with a majority of Republican voters backing him. Biden, facing this challenge, attended a fundraising event, emphasising the USA’s global importance and warning of international uproar if Trump returns. Troublingly, recent polls depict Trump neck-and-neck or ahead of Biden, even in critical swing states. The persistence of Trump’s support amid legal turmoil reflects GOP sentiments, indicating a tough battle ahead for Democrats. The Democrats’ lacklustre response raises concerns. Biden’s sporadic appearances demand a more robust campaign trail effort to counter Trump’s momentum. However, on social media, it seems that the support for both nominees are rather solid. The liberal folks and the conservative folks are determined to support their candidate regardless of what is said about either of them. Will Biden win the next election? Strong blue states like Michigan are waning towards the Republican party. One of the reasons why is due to the economy. Many residents feel that they’re not seeing much improvement under his regime. Democrat supporters are finding this to be shocking as Republicans are generally a lot more conservative, which in their eyes, may not be a good thing for women. Unfortunately, those on the centre feel that both candidates are not suitable for America. They feel that this is what a two party political system does to a country and feel that America deserves better. Be that as it may, a two party political system is more stable than having multiple parties trying to govern the country as votes will be split even further and a majority would not be formed easily.

        "content": "World Inside the Supreme Court’s Dismantling of Roe By Julia Carroll - December 15, 2023 “The intention was to underscore the potential threat to the court’s integrity if such a significant personal freedom was overturned, alongside facing resultant turmoil,” commented Nancy Northup, the president of the Center for Reproductive Rights which represented the clinic. The lawyers from the clinic were apprehensive that any dilution involving the viability line could potentially lead to dissolving of Roe altogether. But protecting Roe wasn’t a straightforward task. Many of those familiar with its legal foundation, rooted in an alleged implicit constitutional right to privacy, have frequently scrutinized it over the years, including liberal thinkers who support the right to abortion based on policy. John Hart Ely penned in The Yale Law Journal in 1973, “It doesn’t constitute constitutional law and barely aims to come close.”. Justice Ginsburg also expressed her reservations about the ruling. During public events, she mentioned that she felt the Supreme Court had acted “too swiftly and too expansively,” and wished the ruling would have rooted in gender-equality grounds. In the oral arguments, some conservative justices showed almost no interest in the course set by the chief. Justice Barrett questioned abortion by suggesting alternatives like adoption. Justice Alito put forward probing questions to Ms. Rikelman regarding the viability standard and history of abortion rights. When she argued that a 15-week limit wouldn’t give women ample time to decide on their pregnancies, Justice Alito brought up a quote from her document. “Your brief claims that ‘there can be no compromise here,’ is this interpretation correct?” He asked. Ms. Rikelman confirmed it was. Later, the justices gathered again for a preliminary vote. Five supported the overturn of Roe, indicating their likely success. The chief seemed to support Mississippi’s 15-week ban, which technically put him in the majority, but he would not extend his support any further. On the contrary, the three liberal justices were in favor of upholding the lower courts’ annulment of the law. Though the chief typically assigns opinions when in the majority, in this case, insiders say it was Justice Thomas, the majority’s senior member, who assigned the opinion to Justice Alito. In his initial draft, Justice Alito stated that both Roe and Casey were not legally sound, asserting that abortion rights have a brief history in the United States and linked abortion to the destruction of an “unborn human being” as termed in the Mississippi law. His next order of business was ensuring the five votes remained intact. Votes within the court are prone to change right up until the announcement of a decision. The swift responses received in February led others in the court to deduce that he had shared the initial draft opinion with his four allies before the entire panel of justices, thereby securing their approval early on.

        "content": "World Mandy Cohen, New CDC Director, Tries to Foster Trust in a Battered Agency By Julia Carroll - December 15, 2023 In November, Dr. Mandy K. Cohen, the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, visited a Fox affiliate in Dallas soon after the Texas governor signed a law preventing private employers from enforcing Covid-19 vaccinations. Despite the politically charged environment, Dr. Cohen showed no signs of hesitation or concern. “Not only am I the C.D.C. director, but I’m also a mother,” she stated, revealing live on television that her 9 and 11-year-old daughters have received their latest Covid and flu vaccinations. She affirmed, “I wouldn’t endorse anything for the American population that I wouldn’t recommend for my own family.” Dr. Cohen has constantly used this down-to-earth approach as she embarks on an arguably impossible mission: reviving faith in public health and in her beleaguered agency amongst a skeptical American public. Irrespective of the pandemic’s official end, Dr. Cohen stands firm on her messaging, five months into her tenure. After the pandemic, the American public’s trust in the agency and science in general suffered a severe blow, especially amongst Republicans. A striking rise in distrust was noted in a Pew Research Center survey, whereby 38% of Republicans expressed little or no confidence in scientists acting in the public’s best interests, a steep increase from 14% in April 2020. Nevertheless, the C.D.C. winter vaccination campaign, sadly, does not appear to be gaining traction. A recent alert warned of potential spikes in severe illnesses and strains on healthcare capacity due to low vaccination rates against the flu, Covid, and respiratory syncytial virus (R.S.V.). Furthermore, political divide over vaccination remains, with only one-quarter of Republicans intending to receive their next Covid shot, compared with seven out of ten Democrats, as per a September KFF poll. Since taking office in July, President Biden’s pick to succeed Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, Dr. Cohen, has embarked on a countrywide media awareness campaign about vaccination. Her numerous efforts comprise of 19 city visits in 13 states, touring 22 vaccination sites, appearing in dozens of television interviews, including NBC’s “Today” show, and maintaining a social media presence with videos titled “Check-In With Dr. Cohen.” She is seen in the videos, often in the company of county health officials and other health practitioners, spreading awareness and endorsing preventive measures against various diseases. In Dallas and Chicago, she managed to converse with the public about the importance of data in health matters and the significance of vaccination, respectively. While interacting with reporters, Cohen often refers to her family. In an interview with The New York Times, she said, “We are all human beings at the end of the day. If we can engage in a real human dialogue about the safety measures I’d undertake for my kids, perhaps that would connect us in an entirely different manner.” Dr. Cohen has inherited an agency undergoing substantial changes. She is dedicated to implementing the overhaul plans initiated by her predecessor, Dr. Walensky, which involves creating a new analytics center and making necessary structural changes to streamline science-to-policy translation. Despite these lofty ambitions, her allies agree that her most crucial challenge would be to alter the public’s perception of her agency. Megaphone missteps during the pandemic by C.D.C. officials and health leaders significantly hampered trust amongst the public. Brian C. Castrucci, the president of de Beaumont Foundation, a public health nonprofit partnering with strategist Frank Luntz, believed public health officials sowed seeds of mistrust by being over-assertive and flip-flopping on their guidance eventually. According to Luntz, his research suggests a significant subset of the public — about 20-25% — has become detached due to public health officials’ seemingly condescending language towards individuals with genuine misgivings. Based on his surveys, a cheat sheet for communication guidance has been developed to help health officials reach out effectively to individuals of all political ideologies. Dr. Tom Frieden, former C.D.C. director and a participant in the project, appreciates Dr. Cohen’s communication approach. “The ultimate goal is to empower individuals with facts, not scold them into altering their behaviors,” he opines. “Dr. Cohen comprehends this aspect well.” Despite a slight increase in flu hospitalizations compared to the previous year and a relatively low Covid vaccination rate among health care staff, lighter news arrived in the form of a freshly released 77,000 dose batch of a new monoclonal antibody shot to prevent R.S.V. in infants. And with R.S.V. cases in Texas also surging, Dr. Cohen intends to perfect the C.D.C.’s narrative around monitoring vaccine safety in response to mounting public concern regarding vaccination side effects. Dr. Cohen is altering how the C.D.C. communicates about itself. During her first appearance before Congress, she described the agency as a “critical national security asset.” Although, according to M. Anthony Mills, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, such framing might not resonate with the general public who are suspicious of government agencies like the C.D.C., National Institutes of Health, and the Food and Drug Administration. “For those who suspect that the N.I.H. lied about funding pandemic-causing research, believe the pharmaceutical industry is colluding with the F.D.A., and see public health initiatives as an infringement on their freedom, such concerns largely do not correlate with national security,” he noted. Unlike Dr. Walensky, who had no previous government experience and was known for seeking media training, Dr. Cohen is not a newcomer when it comes to Washington or media attention. She was a high-ranking official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the Obama administration. After which, as the secretary of health and human services in North Carolina, she advocated for the Republican-majority legislature to accept Medicaid expansion and successfully guided the state through the pandemic. Her nomination to these positions was criticized by more than two dozen congressional Republicans, who accused her of politicizing science. Though, Republicans in North Carolina maintain that their relationship with her, while strained at times, was always respectful and professional. One such Republican, Representative Donny Lambeth, the chair of the Health Committee in the North Carolina House of Representatives, said, “She was always cool and composed before us. She was unflappable.” During her congressional testimony last month, she managed to maintain her calm demeanor throughout. Even when Representative Daniel Crenshaw and Jeff Duncan, both Republicans, put her on the spot, Dr. Cohen skillfully navigated the questions. Instead of succumbing to their demands for regrets and mistakes, she remained forward-thinking and optimistic about her new tenure at the C.D.C., affirming, “We’re in a new place and it’s good news.” New CDC Director, Mandy Cohen, Strives to Rebuild Trust in a Troubled Agency TAGS Agency Battered cdc Cohen director foster Mandy trust Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Linkedin ReddIt Email Telegram Previous article Florida Law Chills Chinese Student Recruitment Julia Carroll",

We loved Tirana and its lively drivers, Berat bewitched us, historical Gjirokaster entranced us and we chilled out by the beach in Himarë. But it was tiny Lin in the Korçë region, eastern Albania, perhaps the oldest inhabited settlement in Europe, dating back to 6,000 BC, that totally captured our hearts. Our accommodation on the shores of Lake Ohrid offered amazing views across to North Macedonia. Delicious homecooked meals, including the tasty local Ohrid brown trout caught by the owner, were served on the terrace overlooking the lake where we were serenaded by a noisy frog chorus.

Young and inclusive, Wrocław There is plenty of scope for boat trips on the rivers and canals of Wrocław. Photograph: ewg3D/Getty Images Wrocław is an underrated city, a place to be immersed in river boat trips, £1.30 pints, chimney cakes and cobbled streets. The cathedrals are stunning, the people are warm and kind and it’s just about within day-trip range of the beautifully preserved German town of Görlitz. As a centre of academia in Poland, it has plenty of inclusive, youth-friendly bars and shops, and for far less money than in France, Belgium or Germany you can enjoy a truly authentic European long weekend. Aaron Every day in Georgia we ate bread filled with oozing cheese An adjaruli khachapuri (cheese-filled bread) Photograph: Radist/Getty Images Khachapuri , bread filled with oozing, melted cheese, was so irresistible, cheap and ubiquitous, I ate it every day for two weeks in Georgia with each regional variation evoking travel memories. Breakfast in Tbilisi was warm imeruli khachapuri , stuffed with sour, salty Imeretian cheese ; while a version full of cheese and nettles warmed the soul on a dreary night in the Kazbegi mountains. In the Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti region of western Georgia, we had megruli khachapuri , with sulguni cheese in the middle and on top, which was like pizza on speed. But we saved the best for the Black Sea resort Batumi: adjaruli , an iconic canoe-shaped bread, full of cheese swimming in butter. Lovely! Helen Jackson Sea, surf, rock arches and beer, Galicia, Spain Catedrais beach. Photograph: Luna Marina/Getty Images Head to As Catedrais beach (Cathedral beach) in Galicia, north-west Spain, for incredible rock formations and turquoise waters. It takes its name from the huge arches which resemble the flying buttresses of a cathedral. During high tide the formations are hidden, but as the tide subsides beautiful arches and caves are revealed. Exploring these and sploshing through the beautifully clear water is pure pleasure. When you’re done exploring there is a cafe on the cliff top serving cold beers with views of the sea and surf below. Laura Tipple in the taverna, Volos, Greece Dishes at a Volos taverna. Photograph: Wirestock, Inc./Alamy Volos is a city in eastern Greece that many pass through en route to the Sporades islands, but we stayed a bit longer and discovered the culture of tsipouradika . Order a small bottle of tsipouro (a wine-based spirit), and a meze or two will come with it. If there are two of you, you get double; four and they quadruple it – it’s a social thing. The first meze are basic: aubergine salad, cured fish. Then the more you drink, the better they get: grilled sea bream, scallops. There are no menus, but as it’s a fishing city, seafood dominates. With hundreds of tsipouradika tavernas throughout Volos, it’s an integral part of local life and one I’m glad to have discovered.

It’s right on the Thames Estuary path. There’s a second world war battery next door, and Coalhouse Fort is at the end of the road. For a real sense of the edge of things, walk up the path to Tilbury Fort just after high tide; it’s lonely, desolate and incredibly atmospheric. This is where Elizabeth I rallied her army nearby to face the threat of the Armada in 1588. It’s a half-mile walk to the jetty for the ferry to Gravesend here. At the other end of East Tilbury is the old Bata estate , a modernist masterpiece best explored by bike. Tim Smith Canny meandering, Essaouira, Morocco Fruit and veg on sale in Essaouira.

Our landlady showed us the way, cannily meandering, pausing to ask a price, split open a pea pod, exchange gossip. Essaouira, best known for surf and seafood, is also ridiculously fertile. November and December are best, when all the key Moroccan ingredients are at their peak. A truckload of corn in their husks? Thick bunches of wormwood? Artichokes, their stalks intact for soup making? One step back from the coast, the Essaouira land was brought to us, and it was delicious.

We enjoyed fudgy brownies from Ardmhor Coffee while waiting at Barra ferry terminal. A day later we arrived, soaked to the skin, at the Hebridean Jewellery Cafe on South Uist and had the best brie and cauliflower soup ever. We ate, overlooking the beach, at the Wee Cottage Kitchen trailer on North Uist; my partner loved his scallop and black pudding roll.

        "description": "Tucked between Walt Disney Studios and Griffith Park, the Burbank Rancho Equestrian District bridges the horse lifestyle and city living.",
        "content": "A spritely woman leading a white horse waves at me from a perfectly suburban street corner in Burbank looking like an ethereal ghost of rodeos past. Instantly, I know it’s Tarrah Barbour, who invited me to visit an equestrian neighborhood tucked in a far-from-rural nook between Walt Disney Studios and Griffith Park. I look up and down the quiet, leafy street just an exhale away from the thumping heartbeat of the San Fernando Valley and wonder where on earth even one horse could be kept. Barbour, 44, buzzing with energy despite rising in the early hours to tend to horses, introduces me to her horse Kota and then leads me around the corner. A parallel rustic world emerges: past a cherry red Chevy pickup truck and horse trailer is the entrance to stables. There I meet Hector Aguilar, who proudly recounts riding USC’s mascot , a horse named Traveler — and whips out a June 2014 copy of The Times featuring a photo of him atop the regal creature to prove it. Sheena Graves , a Hollywood horse wrangler, mills around in serious-looking leather boots. For many residents of the Burbank Rancho Equestrian District, as well as the adjacent Riverside Rancho in Glendale, life revolves around their equine charges. Even with hired help, taking care of the graceful but massive creatures requires investment — of time, money and heart. Karen Thornton, a Burbank Rancho resident with a small gaggle of farm animals, including a horse and a pony, told me that being a horse person leaves virtually no time for other hobbies. Taking vacations is tough. “It’s more of a lifestyle,” she said. For some, it’s a dream come true. “Every morning I wake up and I feel like I’m an 8-year-old girl,” Barbour told me, eyes shining behind oversize circular sunglasses. By the time Barbour starts work (as an advertising producer) at 9:30 a.m., she’s typically exercised three horses. Perhaps a gallop at Griffith Park or lunging — driving a horse around a circle on a rope — in a patch of land called the Pollywog . She checks on the animals at 6 p.m. and then again by 11 p.m. and relies on twice-daily visits by Jose Alberto Lomeli, 80, who, for a half-century, has cared for horses in the area. “Rain, shine, earthquake, every single day — now 24 years without a day off,” Lomeli said. Film studios and equestrians in the area have long enjoyed a symbiotic relationship. Just as the first movie production companies moved into Burbank in the 1920 s, large farms and ranches sprang up. By the 1940s, those expansive lots were subdivided into small homes, many with horse stalls in the back. That proximity became an asset when horses, and someone to handle them, were needed on set. (Horse celebrity Mr. Ed once lived there, USC’s mascot still does.) Most of my horseback riding experience dates back to toddlerhood when my parents took me to the now-closed Griffith Park Pony Rides . But alongside Barbour I feel at ease astride a gentle brown steed named Charlie. We depart from Studio Horse Rental — the only remaining horse rental facility in Burbank — and make our way across the Mariposa Bridge over the L.A. River that connects Burbank to more than 4,000 acres of land in Griffith Park. Ten of us, five riders and five horses, pass under the 134 Freeway and past the Martinez Arena , a first-come, first-served public equestrian area. Eventually, we veer away from concrete and plod along a dirt trail through the trees. I feel comfortable as we saunter along the path — even when the horses switch from a slow walk to a trot. As the pace momentarily quickens, a sense of freedom surges up. Atop the strong, graceful creature, I absorb some of its power. I become conscious of how tall I’ve grown. The allure of horse life clicks. How to get your horse on in the city Barbour says she sometimes rides to Basecamp , a local coffee shop, for a morning cup of joe. So consider that a good starting point. Those who want to experience what it’s like to meander on horseback can book a guided trail ride at one of the local rental facilities. Studio Horse Rental located near the horse bridge on Mariposa Street is open seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and welcomes riders of all skill levels. My one-hour ride through Griffith Park cost $50. Another option is L.A. Horse Rentals , a stone’s throw away in Glendale. Rides between 30 minutes and 1.5 hours are offered daily, with prices ranging from $30 to $75. Longer trail rides can be booked on weekends. If you’re interested in mastering the ropes (and reins as it were), consider taking a lesson. Studio Horse Rental offers them. When dismounting from my ride, I met trainer Lorie Martan, whom my Rancho companions praised for her gifted ways of working with children. L.A. Equestrian Center hosts trainers specializing in an array of training styles. Details are available at thelaec.com . Traditional Equitation School , located in the center, bills itself as the oldest horseback riding school in L.A. Prices start at $93.50 for a single lesson. Experienced riders are welcome to haul over their horse for a day in Griffith, a lunge in the Pollywog or a roll in Martinez Arena. Boarding is available at the Equestrian Center. Food and equipment can be purchased at Damoor’s or Trickee Tack, located on the same lot as L.A. Horse Rentals. And, if you need any leather repairs, hoof it over to A&M Leather Shop, run by Lomeli and his longtime business partner Miguel Angel Garcia and located behind Border Brothers Dry Cleaners & Laundry . 1. Walk — or run — past holiday lights. Ever since I was a teenager, I’ve loved to jog the streets of L.A. as a means to explore neighborhoods. The time between Halloween and Christmas is a particularly great time to do this because you get the seasonal benefit of taking in holiday lights and festive facades. The lights also literally brighten up an evening foray. Walking is perfectly acceptable, but a quicker clip allows you to cover more ground. Need some inspo? My colleague Jeanette Marantos compiled this list of 30 dazzling light displays across Southern California. 2. Experience a winter wonderland at a park near you. Through Dec. 16, dozens of L.A. County parks will be transformed into winterscapes complete with 40 to 80 tons of snow for sledding and playing. Free and open to all ages, the Parks After Dark: Winter Wonderland events will also feature family- and teen-friendly crafts, hot cocoa and snacks, carnival games, toy giveaways, holiday music and more. Hosted by L.A. County Parks and Recreation, the events will be held Fridays and Saturdays from either noon to 4 p.m. or 4 to 8 p.m A full list of parks and their event times is available at parks.lacounty.gov . 3. Get merry on a guided Griffith Park hike. On Dec. 16, naturalist Jason Wise will lead a group on a one-mile hike to celebrate the native fauna in our backyard with a crafty wintertime twist. Participants will forage mistletoe to transform into a decoration, learn about the native California holly and craft ornaments from pine cones. Warm cider, craft supplies and hiking lessons will be provided on the two-hour experience running from noon to 2 p.m. Hosting the hike is Usal Outdoor Research Center, a community hub and store geared toward the “modern nature enthusiast.” Tickets are $30. Details and booking at usalproject.com . Three men, two ropes and one sleeping bag. Those were the essential — and notably minimal — ingredients for a celebrated recent ascent of the north face of dizzyingly sheer Mount Jannu in the Himalayas. Some have summited the daunting peak, but none have done this particularly challenging route in the light alpine style employed by a trio of Americans who successfully reached the 25,295-foot summit on Oct. 12, John Branch explains in a recent piece for the New York Times . Alan Rousseau, Matt Cornell and Jackson Marvell tackled the summit — notorious for its height, steepness and remote locale — without supplemental oxygen, fixed ropes or the help of porters beyond base camp. Top alpinists have lauded the feat as one of the most significant in climbing, exceeding the difficulty of scaling Everest. Besides its impressive athleticism, the climb represents a hopeful alternative to navigating crowds that have improbably become common on Everest and other behemoths. Happy adventuring, Every month, local gallerist Lauren Powell leads a procession of art lovers up a steep trail to a pine tree grove overlooking the L.A. Basin. Besides trail snacks and water bottles, the crew hauls up art, thereby freeing it from the potentially exclusionary gallery space. “I would say this is a pilgrimage to bring the gallery outside of the four walls to the public,” Powell told my colleague Deborah Vankin, who chronicled the recurring ritual . On a recent trek, a group of roughly 30, decked out in primarily sunset-hued threads, carried hulking paintings by Senon Williams, giving off what Vankin described as “a Burning Man -meets- Sierra Club vibe.” Once they reached an area adjacent to the iconic Griffith Observatory, they installed the works for a temporary open-air exhibit. As the sun set, the paintings appeared to dissolve against the golden backdrop. The hikes are free and open to the public, with the next one scheduled for Dec. 17.

        "description": "These Americans abroad seem to be living the dream and thanks to their streams of content, TikTok users can follow along and live vicariously through them.",
        "content": "A month’s paid vacation time. Wine at lunchtime on a Tuesday. No tipping needed. In Kacie Rose Burns’ most , the influencer runs through some of the biggest culture shocks she’s experienced since upping sticks from the US to Italy. Burns’ TikTok – viewed 19.8 million times – is flooded with comments ranging from disbelief, envy and approval. There’s one comment – liked 34,800 times – that maybe sums it all up: “I think the American dream is to leave America.” Burns’ social media accounts chronicle her experiences as, according to her TikTok bio, “that American girl living in Italy.” She details cultural differences, offers guides to Italian cities and speaks directly to the camera about her experiences. The 30-year-old started posting on TikTok in 2021 when she moved to Florence with her Italian boyfriend, who she In early 2021, international travel was off the table. Burns’ videos quickly gained traction thanks to her mix of escapist content, wish fulfillment fantasy and funny-yet-insightful takes on the realities of moving abroad. Cut to today and Burns has 1 million TikTok followers. Fans approach her on the street and act like they know her. She’s leveraged her success into a brand, complete with ebooks and group tours. Chronicling her life in Italy is now her full time job. It’s a career move that Burns, a former New York dancer, says was entirely accidental. The success has taken her by surprise. But Burns isn’t alone. In recent years – as TikTok has ballooned in popularity and Instagram has embraced short-form video content in the shape of Instagram Reels – the American influencer abroad has become an omnipresent figure. No matter your algorithm, if you’re active on these platforms it’s likely you’ve seen a video or two along these lines. Maybe an influencer wandering around a UK grocery store, commenting on how bizarre it is that British stores don’t store eggs in the refrigerator, or someone chronicling their attempts to learn French while in situ in Paris, or showing the incredible views from their red-roofed Lisbon apartment. For American social media user Elizabeth Staub, 31, watching TikTokers who’ve moved abroad is appealing partly because their content feels “like an easy daydream” or “escape.” But it’s a fantasy that’s “also kind of attainable,” as Staub puts it to . These people might seem to have a day-to-day that’s straight out of a Netflix romantic comedy, but they’re real people. And for Staub, it’s this reality that makes it easy to insert herself in their shoes – at least for the few minutes it takes to watch one of their videos. “I really enjoy seeing the differences between our country and wherever these influencers are, and romanticizing what it would be like to live there,” says Staub. “I follow people who live in places I’d want to live,” agrees Boston-based social media user Erin Conry, 26. It feels like a dopamine hit, Conry tells CNN Travel, every time she sees “these aesthetically pleasing travel videos.” These Americans abroad seem to be living the dream and thanks to their streams of content, TikTok users can follow along and live vicariously through them. Many of the most popular videos from US content creators abroad hinge on the little details. Take Quentin Pettiford’s social media presence. Pettiford, 24, moved from the US to Norway in 2021. Like Burns, he emigrated after falling in love with a European, and like Burns, people love hearing about his transatlantic love story – but if his TikTok stats are anything to go by, they’d rather hear his thoughts on the differences between Norwegian and American grocery stores. Pettiford gets it. The first time he walked the aisles of a Norwegian grocery store, he was entranced. For his Norwegian partner, the experience was mundane – boring, even – but for Pettiford, the store was a treasure trove of intriguing cultural differences. He was baffled by the bread slicers, something he’d never seen in an American grocery store. He soon learned that when you leave certain stores in Norway, you have to scan your receipt in order to open the doors. “Everything about the grocery stores here in Norway is just so different,” Pettiford tells CNN Travel. Pettiford immediately started filming clips and posting on his . “I knew that if the right people saw it, they’d be interested and it would go viral,” he says. Sure enough, one day Pettiford opened the TikTok app to thousands of comments, views and follows. “It got two million views in a couple of weeks,” says Pettiford of his first viral video. “I was like, ‘You know what, I’m not going to let this opportunity slip.” Pettiford dove head on into content creation. Today, he intersperses funny commentary on cultural differences with glimpses into his day-to-day family life with his Norwegian wife and their young daughter. His followers seem to enjoy that family content, says Pettiford, but his most popular video isn’t particularly personal at all – it’s “me talking about how Americans use Fahrenheit, and how the rest of the world uses Celsius.” “That got, like, 8 million views,” says Pettiford, sounding disbelieving. “Little things like that, people go crazy for. So I just kind of sit back, reflect on what’s different, write it in my notes and then talk about it and see if it goes viral.” Burns and Pettiford both started posting during the pandemic – partly because they found themselves with more time on their hands and partly because that’s just when they happened to move abroad. But thirtysomething Fatima, an American content creator who runs the TikTok , had lived in Paris for several years before she started posting publicly about her life in early 2021. Like former dancer Burns, Fatima worked in the performing arts industry pre-2020 and found herself turning to social media as a “different way to be creative” when Covid hit. Fatima, who has requested her last name not be included in this article for personal reasons, was also inspired to start posting publicly in the wake of the Netflix hit “Emily in Paris.” The much talked about TV show tracks a fictional American social media influencer who moves to a version of Paris that bears little resemblance to the city’s reality, but which quickly enamored locked-down-viewers when the show landed on Netflix in late 2020. Fatima watched – and enjoyed – “Emily in Paris.” But seeing the show’s success also prompted her desire to show a more realistic view of the “American in Paris” tale. It’s a tale, Fatima acknowledges, that is, if not as old as time, certainly pretty old – she recalls watching the 2014 Broadway musical “An American in Paris,” based on the 1950s movie, the week before she moved to France. The pop culture trope of an American moving to Europe and living a charmed life also extends beyond Paris and predates the 21st century – think 1954’s Rome-set “Three Coins in the Fountain.” For millennial Fatima, it was the 2003 “Lizzie McGuire Movie” – in which American teen Lizzie takes a trip to Italy and is accidentally mistaken for a pop star – that first had her dreaming about moving to Europe. “That movie is very iconic for me, very important,” says Fatima. “When I finally went to Italy, and I was in front of the Trevi Fountain, I couldn’t stop talking about it. And I kid you not – like five minutes into like me being in that location, there was another American talking about the same movie.” Fatima points out that most of these movies and TV shows depict “White women of a certain socio-economic background moving to Europe to pursue their ‘Eat, Pray, Love lifestyle.’” Fatima realized her TikTok was an opportunity to broaden that overriding pop culture narrative. “To be a Black American in Paris, it really does inform how I go about my life in this country,” she says. In one of the pinned videos on Fatima’s TikTok, she’s shown walking around picturesque Parisian streets, speaking directly to the camera and promising followers “range, details, information, tips, tricks, silly stories of my times past, and TBH just my reality of living in Paris.” directly engages with the pop culture tropes of Americans living abroad. For one, there’s a direct reference to fictional “Emily” – Fatima calls herself “Fatima in Paris” both in the video and her TikTok bio. And the video is soundtracked to the “Sex and the City” theme music – nodding to the moment in that series when fictional heroine Carrie Bradshaw decided to start over in Paris. “My content does have an aspect of escapism, and that’s by design,” says Fatima. “I try to make content that is fun and engaging for me, and also fun and engaging for the audience that might want to consume it.” For Fatima, social media has also turned out to be an alternative revenue stream – although she doesn’t make a full time living off her content, she does make a profit. “To put things into perspective, I have made enough money (post taxes) to pay two months worth of rent including utilities in the calendar year of 2023,” she tells CNN Travel. Kacie Rose Burns also makes money from her social media content via occasional branded content, but she says social media only became a full time career once she began running group tours in Italy and started her business. Burns says she also avoids any branded content she doesn’t think will resonate with her followers. For both Burns and Fatima, keeping their content as “real” as possible is important to them. For example, while Fatima’s content always has an appealing touch of glamor, she stresses to CNN that “living in France, living in Paris, is not this idealistic perfect utopia that a lot of people set it out to be” “I’m fully aware of that and fully cognizant of that. And every now and then I do talk about that on my platforms. I talk about the realities of living in this country,” she says. Burns – who, like Fatima, is well aware of the pop culture tropes she’s playing with – also says she tries to strike that equilibrium in her content. “It’s healthy to romanticize your life so that you find beauty in it,” Burns says. “But I also think it’s important, at the same time, to talk about the hard parts too, because life in Italy is not like ‘Lizzie McGuire.’ It does have its pain points. It’s not like ‘Under the Tuscan Sun.’ It’s not like ‘Eat, Pray, Love.’ There are definite, hard challenges to overcome. And there are a lot of things such as homesickness, that will never fully go away.” While a lot of popular social media accounts chart the adventures of Americans in Europe, there are accounts depicting “fish out of water” adventures across the globe. Ananya Donapati’s TikToks, for example, chronicles her life as an American in Japan. For the 23-year-old Californian, moving to Japan was the culmination of a dream that started when she discovered manga comics and started learning Japanese in her early teens. When the pandemic hit, Donapati almost cast the dream aside, figuring it was never going to be possible. But then the founder of a Japanese fintech startup found Donapati’s popular Twitter account and reached out, offering her a marketing job. Donapati left the US for Tokyo earlier this year. Although she was big on Twitter, now called X, it didn’t occur to Donapati to create TikToks about her new life until she started seeing other Americans doing the same. Now Donapati posts regular dispatches, funny observations and guides to Tokyo on her account The goal, says Donapati, is “to share what Japan has to offer, through the beauty that I see through my eyes, through my content.” Donapati had no qualms about filming herself and her experiences, she’s Gen Z and grew up watching YouTubers. To her, the whole thing seemed “kind of natural.” “I’ve always wanted to create content,” says Donapati “And I feel like a lot of people my age tend to have that desire.” Donapati enjoys the creativity that comes with the platform’s limitations – videos have to be short and snappy to catch the attention of a scrolling, time poor social media user who wants to “see something new, wants to be entertained,” as Donapati puts it. “So the more that you’re yourself and creative, I think you really get a lot of eyes on you, and a lot of support as well.” Donapati still enjoys watching content created by other Americans in Japan. She finds comfort in seeing some of her experiences reflected back at her, and also finds these videos helpful as she continues to navigate life abroad. “It’s extremely important to rely on each other, get advice,” she says. “And I think the content creation that everyone’s doing is kind of an extension of that.” Donapati also enjoys watching American content creators who post about their life elsewhere in the world. For Donapati, the appeal is that it’s “very real.” “I really like seeing, let’s say, someone in Europe and their life living there,” she says. “I definitely watch videos like that, it’s great, because I feel like I’m there without having to be there.” It’s not only American content creators who post about their experiences abroad on social media. Donapati also follows Japanese content creators living in the US, while Fatima likes reliving her New York years via content created by Europeans who’ve relocated to the US. But the proliferation of Americans posting about their experiences abroad suggests it’s a particularly popular trend in the US. US social media user Elizabeth Staub suggests glimpses of life abroad grow ever more appealing to Americans “as our country becomes a mess with regards to healthcare, affordable living and lack of third spaces in our community.” Burns suggests it’s also because the difficulties associated with international travel in the US didn’t end when pandemic travel restrictions were lifted. “We don’t have federal paid time off, people can’t take time off work, flying is impossible, it costs thousands of dollars to take a flight to Europe – it’s really expensive,” she says. “It’s just not a reality for a lot of people.” There’s a stereotype, suggests Burns, that Americans aren’t interested in traveling abroad. But many people, especially younger Americans, “want so badly to travel, but maybe they don’t necessarily have the means to do it.” “So they travel through their phone,” she says. “It’s easy to find Americans traveling abroad [on TikTok] and then they’re able to experience it through somebody that has a similar background.” Her words are echoed by social media user Erin Conry. “They’re living my dream,” she says of the Americans abroad she follows. The content she loves is informative and insightful, but overall just a “great escape.” “It’s cool to see that people have the confidence to actually live out that kind of life.” The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "description": "For the first time ever, Disneyland has released details on each of the seasonal celebrations, special events and limited-time offerings planned for the year ahead.",
        "content": "Disneyland fans will need to go out and buy their 2024 calendar a little earlier than usual now that the full lineup of events and dates has been released for all of next year at the Anaheim theme parks. For the first time ever, Disneyland has released details on each of the seasonal celebrations, special events and limited-time offerings planned for the year ahead. The calendar will be filled on more than 300 days of the 366-day leap year in 2024 with a slate of festivities at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure. Disneyland decided to release the full calendar for 2024 during the first full week of December 2023 so fans can plan ahead and book reservations well in advance of the upcoming event. The advance planning strategy brings Disneyland more in line with Walt Disney World where visitors plan months in advance for vacations tied to specific events and times of the year. Disneyland hopes to encourage visitors to stretch overnight or weekend stays into longer vacations that extend into multiday or weeklong trips — just like travelers at the Florida theme park resort. The Disneyland calendar was recently extended to a 180-day window so visitors can plan further in advance and book theme park reservations and hotel stays. Here’s the lineup of events planned for Disneyland and Disney California Adventure in 2024. The annual food festival paying tribute to Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese traditions returns to DCA. The Year of the Dragon celebration means Mushu will lead Mulan’s Lunar New Year parade. Disneyland announced plans for four after-hours, separate admission special events in the first half of 2024 — without providing any details on themes or dates. The five Disneyland After Dark events in 2023 included the returning Sweethearts Nite (late January and early February), Throwback Nite (mid-April) and Star Wars Nite (early May) along with the new Princess Nite (early March) and Pride Nite (mid June). Previous years have seen Villains Nite, Pixar Nite, Grad Nite Reunion, 80s Nite and 90s Nite. Star Wars Nite and Sweethearts Nite are likely locked in for 2024 with the other two slots remaining open for new or returning special events. Chances are good for a Pixar Nite tied to Pixar Fest starting in late April. The annual tribute to gospel music returns to the Fantasyland Theatre with a pair of headliner musicians and a host of Southern California community choirs. The Feb. 17 show will be headlined by Marvin Sapp and the Feb. 24 show will feature Tasha Cobbs. The Anaheim NHL team celebrates its 30th anniversary in DCA’s Hollywood Land. Current and former Ducks players will take part in a fan zone with plenty of photo opportunities and a cavalcade parade. The 2024 version of the venerable Food & Wine Festival returns to DCA with California-centric food, beer and wine, celebrity chefs and Disney characters dressed in their best foodie attire. Fans of the classic Soarin’ Over California will get another chance to hang glide over Napa Valley, Monterey Bay and Redwood Creek when the classic version of the flight simulator ride returns during the food fest. The annual Star Wars celebration returns to Tommorowland and Galaxy’s Edge for a two-month run on either side of May 4 — the unofficial holiday of the epic saga. New planetary excursions will be added to Star Tours starting on April 5. Also starting on April 5, a galactic soundtrack featuring Star Wars symphonic music will be played in Galaxy’s Edge during Disneyland fireworks shows. Hyperspace Mountain will be back in Tomorrowland along with specialty Star Wars-themed food, drinks and merchandise. The Pixar-centric festival that helped launch Pixar Pier in 2018 is back again at both parks. The new Better Together parade will debut at DCA while the “Together Forever” fireworks and projection show returns to Disneyland with a few new scenes. The red panda version of Mei Lee and the 4*Town boy band from “Turning Red” along with Ember and Wade from “Elemental” will be among the characters taking part in Pixar Fest. The reimagined Paradise Pier Hotel will officially become Pixar Place Hotel on Jan. 30 — giving fans a chance to add an extra dose of Pixar to the 10-week festival. The nighttime spectacular returns to the Rivers of America with a new climactic battle scene between Sorcerer Mickey and Maleficent. A fire that destroyed the towering audio-animatronic Maleficent dragon forced a yearlong renovation of the show. Seasonal decor will once again fill both parks with a massive Mickey Mouse jack-o-lantern on Main Street U.S.A., Headless Horseman statue on Buena Vista Street and Radiator Screams makeover of Cars Land. Expect to see the return of holiday attraction overlays for the Haunted Mansion in Disneyland and Guardians of the Galaxy — Mission: Breakout, Mater’s Junkyard Jamboree and Luigi’s Rollickin’ Roadsters in Disney California Adventure. DCA’s Plaza de la Familia event in Paradise Gardens celebrating the Mexican traditions of Dia de los Muertos with music from “Coco” runs a few extra days through Nov. 2. Disneyland attached dates to virtually every event in 2024 except one: Oogie Boogie Bash. The wildly-popular Halloween event sold out in 12 hours in 2023. Announcing the Oogie Boogie Bash dates too soon might lead to squatters booking Disney hotel rooms that would need to be canceled later if fans can’t manage to get tickets for the event. The Christmas season has become one of the busiest times of the year at Disneyland. While it’s too soon to book theme park tickets for Christmas 2024, it’s not too early to begin thinking about what you’re going to do next holiday season — before this one has really gotten started. The Disney Festival of Holidays will once again return to Disney California Adventure Park in 2024. The former Splash Mountain log flume ride is undergoing a transformation into a new attraction themed to Disney’s 2009 animated film “ThePrincess and the Frog.”",

There are extra trains on weekdays between Nottingham and Birmingham and some thinning out (yet again) of TransPennine Express schedules. A new high-speed line through Spain’s Cantabria mountains opened last month. Photograph: Gonzalo Azumendi/Getty Images However, across the Channel, the unstoppable rail renaissance continues apace, with many new services in the 2024 schedules. In much of Europe those 2024 timetables were introduced on 10 December. There are exceptions. A new high-speed line through Spain’s Cantabrian mountains opened in late November, and new timetables for some routes in Poland and the Baltic states won’t come into effect for another week or two. Winners and losers For the most part, the 2024 timetables are good news for rail travellers. Of course, there are winners and losers. Copenhagen secures more direct services to Hamburg, while Aarhusloses out as its direct trains to Hamburg are axed. Few will shed too many tears in Aarhus as the compensation for losing those twice-daily direct trains is a new connecting service every two hours from Denmark’s second-largest city which, with an easy same-platform change of train in Kolding, will get travellers to Hamburg faster than the direct trains. Rail services shape our mental maps of Europe. The German city of Nuremberg was for years a jumping-off point for rail journeys to the Czech Republic. The range of Czech destinations from Nuremberg has been trimmed over the years, but until last week there were still five direct trains each day to the Czech Republic. Now there are none, although, in fairness, there is no shortage of other cross-border routes linking Germany with the Czech Republic. Berlin now has a direct night train to Paris. Photograph: Sylvain Sonnet/Getty Images Each year’s new timetables create links between communities that just a few weeks earlier were unconnected. Paris and Berlin now have a direct night train , reinstating a link that was severed at the start of the pandemic when the Russian Railways train from Paris to Berlin and Moscow ran for the last time. As of this week, the historic cities of Aachen and Halle find themselves linked by a new direct night train. A Nightjet leaves the city of Charlemagne just after 9pm and arrives 10 hours later in Halle, the city in central Germany which so profoundly influenced the Pietist movement. What better journey for anyone interested in German history? New opportunities Tour operators and travel agents are quick to pore over each December’s new train schedules to create new itineraries. Cat Jones, CEO of flight-free operator Byway Travel , says: “All these new trains across Europe are creating a real buzz at Byway. We’re now able to pair places in holidays where direct trains didn’t exist before. The new Euronight direct sleeper linking Salzburg with Kraków, for example, creates a real opportunity for culture vultures to combine [trips to] two very different cities.” That new Salzburg-Kraków link takes almost 10 hours and is among many new city pairs opened up by the new night train linking Munich with Warsaw. The Warsaw-bound train that left Munich on the evening of 10 December was the first direct departure from Bavaria to Poland since 2010. Kraków has a new link to Salzburg, in Austria Photograph: Antagain/Getty Images In the new timetables, we see many city pairs that are already well served by direct daytime trains securing an overnight link. From this week, travellers can snooze in the comfort of a sleeping car from Dresden to Budapest, Vienna and Graz. All three cities have long had daytime trains from Dresden, but now there is an extra option. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Traveller Free newsletter Get travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian Holidays Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Béziers and Montpellier will now have a direct link with Paris on some nights, with the first departures tomorrow. Here, of course, there is competition from direct daytime trains, with the fastest TGVs dashing from Montpellier to the capital in little more than three hours. Another new French overnight train is the Aurillac-Paris service, where there are no competing direct daytime trains. As with all French night trains, they offer little by way of creature comforts. There are no sleeping cars, so passengers must choose between a reclining seat and a couchette. But prices are keen, with fares from €19 for seats and €29 for couchettes. Crossing borders Much has been made of the fact that Europe’s rail operators often focus on their domestic markets and neglect cross-border connections. The ambition of some rail companies does flag as they approach international frontiers, but there are plenty of improved cross-border opportunities. This week has seen increased frequency between Munich and Zürich, hard on the heels of big improvements in November, when direct trains from Stuttgart to Zürich were reinstated. On the busy Berlin-Amsterdam route, journey time has been trimmed by 30 minutes, to under six hours. There is a cross-border service from Latvia, above, to Lithuania for the first time since before Covid. Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images The number of direct daytime trains from Kraków to both Vienna and Berlin doubles from one to two and the Polish city of Wrocław acquires a new early-morning direct train to Vienna, returning late afternoon. From last weekend, there has been a second direct train from Vienna to Ukraine. Complementing the longstanding Euronight service from Vienna to Kyiv, the morning departure from Vienna to Romania now also has through-carriages to Chop, in Ukraine’s Transcarpathia region. It is a mark of how EU-based rail operators promoting better connectivity with western Ukraine. Czech private operator RegioJet is said to be exploring the possibility of a new direct overnight train from Prague to Chop from early 2024. It is even possible that cross-border services from Lithuania to Latvia may be reinstated before the end of the year. The habitually cautious editors of the wonderful European Rail Timetable suggest in their newly published winter edition that “a through Vilnius to Riga train is expected to start running from 27 December”. If this comes to pass, it will be the first public train service between the two capitals since before the pandemic. And it will mean dedicated rail travellers will once again be able to travel by train all the way from England to Estonia without resorting to a bus for that cross-border hop from Lithuania into Latvia.

        "content": "A female black bear sits in a tree near Lake Tahoe, Calif. In an extremely rare incident, a California man was reportedly bitten numerous times by a black bear in Friday. The Calpine resident told authorities he let his dog outside to use the bathroom as usual on Saturday evening, but noticed the dog bolted. When he went outside to find him, a bear emerged from his neighbor’s yard and “charged at him,” the Sierra County Sheriff’s Office said in a . The bear then reportedly bit the man on the hand, wrist and leg. The man escaped back into his home, retrieved a shotgun and shot the black bear while the animal was in a standoff with his dog. The shotgun blast seriously wounded the bear. Advertisement Article continues below this ad The California Department of Fish and Wildlife subsequently located and euthanized the bear, then took the remains to Sacramento to test for rabies. The man is recovering after receiving treatment for his injuries in a hospital. “The bear had been shot at close range, was bleeding heavily and mortally wounded,” Capt. Patrick Foy at Fish and Wildlife told SFGATE over the phone Wednesday. “The decision was made to euthanize it through compassion.” Foy said a wildlife officer killed the bear on-site with a patrol rifle. It’s an exceedingly unusual example of a bear, outside, charging at and repeatedly biting a human. The sheriff’s statement did not detail if the bear had cubs or if the dog was acting aggressively. “Very, very, very rare. I’ve never heard of that happening,” said Ann Bryant, executive director of the Bear League, a wildlife rescue organization in Tahoe. “The only time I heard of such a thing in 30 years of dealing with bears in California would be if the bear was in an enclosed area with no way out, and the person was blocking its escape route. Then they may push a person out of the way and maybe scratch them.” Advertisement Article continues below this ad Foy and Bryant agreed that bears attacking dogs is also rare. Bryant said it has happened on occasion, if a dog has a hold of a mother bear’s cub. Black bears — the still in California — have never killed a human in the wild in the state’s recorded history. “They don’t pick fights,” Bryant said. — — — —",

        "description": "If you didn’t know, Puerto Rico has become one of the most exciting destination-dining scenes in the Caribbean.",
        "content": "Maybe you’ve heard about the ascendant restaurant scene in Puerto Rico. Most people haven’t: The island is still principally known as a highly convenient place for sun and beaches, with no passport required for U.S. citizens, and the food scene is often relegated to what’s convenient to cruise ship ports. If you didn’t know, Puerto Rico has become one of the most exciting destination-dining scenes in the Caribbean. It’s rich with exciting concepts and heritage-minded chefs who showcase culinary traditions and fresh local ingredients in ways that range from ingenious riffs on Puerto Rican classics to exuberant explorations of Mediterranean cuisine—and even noteworthy pizza. This is all happening in spite of the long-lasting impact of Hurricane Maria in 2017 and the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, those two crippling events inspired many chefs to work with the most readily available ingredients — what they could obtain from the island’s fields and surrounding waters —while also giving them opportunity to cultivate fresh concepts. The creative wave in dining options is surging as Puerto Rico welcomes a record-breaking influx of visitors. As of August, year-to-date arrivals at San Juan’s Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport climbed to 4.2 million passengers, an increase of 20% compared to the same period last year. According to Tourism Economics, travel and tourism brought in approximately $8.7 billion in revenue for the year through June, a 63% increase from 2018 highs. As of the second quarter this year, AirDNA has tracked a 12% increase in lodging demand for the year, while independent rental demand more than doubled since 2019. As the food scene has expanded, both in San Juan and within reasonable driving distance, restaurant prices remain affordable, especially in comparison with other Caribbean destinations such as Anguilla and St. Barts. Here are the seven most exciting places to eat in Puerto Rico, from a fine dining farm-to-table restaurant helmed by the island’s first James Beard Award-winning chef to a wood-fired homage to the region’s cooking traditions. Cocina al Fondo Natalia Vallejo, who scored the title of James Beard Best Chef South in June, transforms local produce and protein foods into dishes that speak to the island’s heritage. Delicately fried lionfish is served in a country bean casserole; yellowfin crudo is enlivened with caramelized pineapple. Meals at her villa-style San Juan restaurant, with its verdant backyard patio, feel like lively dinner parties. They’re powered by cocktails from bar star Karla Torres, who deftly weaves regional fruits, flowers and botanicals into memorable libations. Tia Dora Tucked away near San Juan’s beachy, breezy Ocean Park community, chef Raul Corea’s slim restaurant evokes the Mediterranean. The food, served mezze style, is colorful and creative: Options include fire-roasted prawns, daubed with preserved lemon aioli and served with magenta triangles of watermelon radish, and bucatini tossed with za’atar and parmesan in a reimagined cacio e pepe; entrees start at $23. Vegan options abound, too. The cocktail menu is equally compelling, full of such delectable riffs as a cooling cucumber sumac margarita. Café Caleta Set near the historic Catedral de San Juan Bautista, this charming newcomer is a coffee shop by day and a wine-cocktail bar at night. Don’t ask for any flavor shots with your expertly pulled espresso drinks; Caleta doesn’t believe in them. Alongside is a fun, funky selection of bottles and classic-inspired tipples, including a righteous mezcal-powered Negroni. The food served throughout the day is internationally influenced: horchata-spiced challah bread French toast at breakfast, house-made pastrami stacked on a bialy-like pretzel bun for the lunch crowd and, at dinner, catch-of-the-day ceviche crowned with crunchy peanuts. (Dishes at night start at $14.) La Santurcina One of the newest additions to the island’s pizza scene may be its best. Located in San Juan’s vibe-y Santurce neighborhood, its airy space is decorated with slice-minded pop art and plenty of plants. Chef-owner Francis Guzman and chef Stephen Reyna, who also helm the city’s celebrated farm-to-table restaurant Vianda, turn out beautifully bubbled, Neapolitan-inspired rounds, often with clever vegetable toppings such as their signature Beetaroni, with thinly sliced, sausage-spiced beets. Tables fill up quickly, so arriving early will bring the best chance of scoring a seat. Celeste Snuggled between Old San Juan and Condado in Puerta de Tierra, this chic seafood-centric wine bar highlights fresh catches from the surrounding waters. Chef-owner Sebastián Martínez Tully’s seemingly simple plates have complex flavors, such as cubes of raw yellowfin tuna tossed in umami-packed curry leaf oil and grilled razor clams lavished with arugula-embellished chili sauce. Don’t miss the desserts, including tender chocolate cake topped with a cloud of allspice-accented whipped cream and a drizzle of honey-sesame caramel. El Pretexto This verdant, 3.5-acre mountaintop retreat outside Cayey on the southeastern end of the island — an hour from San Juan — offers immersive property tours and dinners twice a week. Founder Crystal Díaz is a super connector who knows everyone in Puerto Rico’s food community; she hosts sunset soirees that begin with a walk through her bountiful garden and orchard and past the property’s newest villa. The four-course meals by acclaimed chef Luis Cabrero, which go for $75, unfold on the deck with a view of the hills tumbling down to the azure Caribbean coastline. The seasonal dishes blend influences from the diaspora, European colonizers and Caribbean culture, such as chorizo-packed chickpea stew served with a toasted slab of garlic-rubbed baguette from a local baker. Bacoa Three veteran chefs from Puerto Rico power this exuberant, exciting enterprise: Tia Dora’s Correa, René Marichal and Xavier Pacheco. The restaurant is situated in a restored hacienda overlooking a small, stream-fed lake on a finca (country estate) in the town of Juncos on the eastern end of the island, a 45-minute drive from San Juan. The menu, which capitalizes on wood-fired grilling, offers refined interpretations of Puerto Rican favorites: salted cod fritters, crispy skinned branzino with slender ribbons of calabaza squash, and sausage pudding in a glistening puddle of pork demi-glace. ___ ©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

        "description": "The child's attorney said he doesn't believe a White child would have been arrested under similar circumstances.",
        "content": "A 10-year-old Black child who urinated in a parking lot must serve three months’ probation and write a two-page book report on the late NBA star Kobe Bryant, a Mississippi judge has ordered. Tate County Youth Court Judge Rusty Harlow handed down the sentence Tuesday after the child's lawyer reached an agreement with a special prosecutor. The prosecution threatened to upgrade the charge of “child in need of supervision” to a more serious charge of disorderly conduct if the boy's family took the case to trial, said Carlos Moore, the child’s attorney. “I thought any sensible judge would dismiss the charge completely. It’s just asinine,\" Moore said. \"There were failures in the criminal justice system all the way around.” Moore said he doesn’t believe a White child would have been arrested under similar circumstances, and he couldn't find a similar instance of a child receiving a similar sentence for the same offense. “I don’t think there is a male in America who has not discreetly urinated in public,” Moore said. The child’s mother has said her son urinated behind her vehicle while she was visiting a lawyer’s office in Senatobia, Mississippi, on Aug. 10. Police officers in the town of about 8,100 residents, 40 miles south of Memphis, Tennessee, saw the child urinating and arrested him. Officers put him in a squad car and took him to the police station. Senatobia Police Chief Richard Chandler said the child was not handcuffed, but his mother said he was put in a jail cell, according to . Days after the episode, Chandler said the officers violated their training on how to deal with children. He said one of the officers who took part in the arrest was “no longer employed,” and other officers would be disciplined. He didn’t specify whether the former officer was fired or quit, or what type of discipline the others would face. Chandler did not immediately respond to a voicemail message Thursday. Reached by phone, a staffer for Paige Williams, the Tate County Youth Court prosecutor appointed to handle the case, said the attorney could not comment on cases involving juveniles. Rashad Robinson, president of the civil rights organization Color Of Change, said the decision to charge the child didn’t make sense. “Nothing about this case from the decisions by the police, the prosecutor, and the judge makes us safer or is a good use of taxpayer resources,\" Robinson said in a statement. He said there is a “long and unforgivable history in Mississippi and across the country” of a “two-tiered justice system” that offers one path for Black children and another for White. It was initially unclear whether prosecutors would take up the case. Moore requested a dismissal, but prosecutors declined. He planned on going to trial but shifted strategy after prosecutors threatened to upgrade the charges. The child's family chose to accept the probation sentence because it would not appear on the boy's criminal record. The 10-year-old is required to check in with a probation officer once per month. Williams initially wanted the child to write a report on public decency, but the judge changed the subject to Bryant because the boy is a basketball fan, Moore said. Marie Ndiaye, deputy director of the Justice Project at the Advancement Project, a racial justice organization, said the arrest is emblematic of broader issues in the criminal justice system. “Sentencing anyone, let alone a young child, to probation under these facts is sure to add to the trauma and denigration this child has suffered since their arrest,” Ndiaye said. “This is all the more proof that we need to severely limit police interactions with civilians, from petty retail theft to traffic stops and even so-called ‘quality of life’ offenses. For Black people in America, it is a matter of life and death.”",

        "content": "Cornel West said in a new interview that he believes President Biden may drop out of the 2024 race in the coming months, amid mounting criticism over foreign policy and the economy. “I’m not even sure whether I’ll be running against Biden,” the independent presidential candidate . “Biden — I think he’s going to have an LBJ moment [and] pull back.” Former President Johnson announced he would not seek reelection on March 31, 1968, just months before the election, amid concerns over his health and criticism of the Vietnam War. West said there is a real chance Biden’s campaign doesn’t make it to November. “I’m just saying that I’m open to those possibilities, given the fluidity of the situation,” the renowned academic said. “He’s running out of gas.” West said his real race is against some Democrats who haven’t declared their candidacy for the White House — Govs. Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) and Gretchen Whitmer (D-Mich.). And while he said the Republican ticket appears more solid, he added that it’s also possible former President Trump leaves the race “if the weight becomes too heavy with the indictments and court processes.” West described Trump as a “pied piper” and a “fascist,” and Biden as a “milquetoast neoliberal.” He said both could lead the country down dark paths, Trump to a civil war and Biden to World War III. “I’m more concerned about Trump domestically,” West said. “I’m more concerned about Biden in terms of foreign policy.” West, who is running his own unaffiliated independent bid after campaigns with the People’s Party and Green Party, has received little support in national polling, while his campaign has attracted mostly disaffected young people and progressives. He has received an support in polls that include him alongside Biden and Trump, though that figure excludes other third-party candidates. In the new interview, West also downplayed concerns that he to Biden’s reelection. “There might be slices of people ‘if I didn’t vote for West, I would have voted for Biden,’” he said. “But that’s not to me, a spoiler. If you’re in a race, and you make a case, and they vote for you, how do you become the spoiler?” West has already qualified for the ballot in Alaska, he said, and hopes to make the ballot in at least 40 states by Election Day.

        "description": "The healing process for the survivors of the Oct. 7 assaults begins with being heard and believed.",
        "content": "The events of Oct. 7 and the war that has followed, at an incomprehensible scale of civilian violence and death, is devastating. This war so far away feels palpably close to us all and has shaken our community to its core. For us as women, there has been an additional aspect of the attacks on Oct. 7 that has felt like a double assault: the systemic rape of women and girls by Hamas terrorists and the lack of response from the world. Sexual and gender-based violence is horrific, with emotional wounds that linger well beyond the physical wounds. The healing process for the survivors of the Oct. 7 assaults begins with being heard and believed. We cannot overstate the importance of supporting these women, like we would all survivors of sexual and gender-based violence. We recoiled when reading about Shani Louk, a 23-year-old German Israeli, who can be seen in a Hamas-made video, semiconscious and half-naked, being taken to Gaza in the back of a pickup truck with men sitting astride her. Another video shows a woman being led out of a vehicle by heavily armed men, her wrists and ankles sliced open and her jeans bloodied at the crotch. First responders have recounted finding dead Israeli women with unmistakable evidence of rape and mutilation. Our heartbreak is not only that these brutal sexual assaults were perpetrated against these women and girls, but that so many international women’s organizations and leaders remained silent about it for too long. That is why this has felt like a double assault. We ask that all people of goodwill acknowledge this assault, horror and heartbreak. Your bearing witness matters. Speaking in solidarity supports survivors to describe the horrors they endured without fear. When survivors believe they will not be believed or that the crime will be minimized, many will not speak up for fear of retraumatization. Speaking in solidarity, we bring attention to the urgent need to release all hostages still being held in Gaza, including those who endured or witnessed sexual and gender-based crimes — enabling them to receive the vital physical and emotional medical care that they are currently being denied. Speaking in solidarity, we increase pressure on organizations to condemn and sanction the perpetrators, which helps prevent the recurrence of these severe violations of international law and fundamental morality. Related Articles As so many know firsthand, sexual and gender-based violence can be devastating, and the shame lingers well beyond the physical wounds. By speaking in solidarity, we enable the survivors of sexual and gender-based violence and their families — and the families of the victims who did not survive, like Louk — to feel the support they need to help them begin to heal. We can join with grassroots efforts in Israel and elsewhere, such as the , which has launched the Civil Commission on Oct. 7 Crimes by Hamas against Women and Children. This unique and all-too-rare collaboration of international human rights experts and women’s rights organizations was created to gather Oct. 7 testimony, evidence and advocacy and to provide expert advice. This week, the Jewish community celebrated Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights. We are reminded that even a small flame can dispel the darkness. In that spirit, may we come together to kindle flames of hope for the world we all share, and the type of world we hope to create, together.",

        "content": "Buffalo and Western New York are known for several things, from football and hockey to its amazing architecture; the Queen City is a great place to live, work, and play. One of the things that we do especially well in the 716 is art and history. Folks may not realize it, but Buffalo has some world-class art right here in Western New York. From art museums like Buffalo AKG Art Museum and Burchfield Penney Art Center to the Buffalo History Museum to all of the public art displays that sprinkle the city, there are tons of great things for you to see and take selfies in front of. One great spot in the area to do just that is down at Canalside in downtown Buffalo. Just steps from the Buffalo River and Lake Erie, you can find all sorts of exciting things to check out. Some of these include sculptures like Shark Girl, the Silent Poets, and statues honoring famous Buffalo sports players like Tim Horton and The French Connection. Thanks to a partnership between the Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation (ECHDC), Empire State Development, and Visit Buffalo Niagara (VBN), a for us all to enjoy. In a big ceremony last week, officials ECHDC, VBN, and ESD unveiled a new permanent sculpture on Marine Drive, near the intersection with Hanover Street. That new sculpture is called BUF and features three steel 3-D letters—the sculpture stands 5 feet tall, with each letter weighing more than 1,000 pounds. This new sculpture was designed and fabricated by and painted by Buffalo's Nicole Cherry. Buffalonians are proud of their city, so we expect the BUF sculpture at Canalside to quickly become a popular selfie site... We have seen how prominent pieces of public art enhance the millions of dollars Governor Hochul has invested in the waterfront. I encourage families to take their holiday pictures by the new sculpture then head to the ice to say hello to Shark Girl and enjoy some time skating, riding the ice bikes, sipping hot chocolate, and taking in the holiday lights. -Joan Kesner, Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation Board Chairperson.

        "content": "From the final season of The Crown to the latest Mark Wahlberg action comedy, there’s something new for everyone this week! Not sure which new releases to check out? Let us here at Decider help you figure out what to watch this weekend and where to stream it. The end of Netflix’s The Crown is upon us, and all six of the show’s final episodes are now available to watch. On Prime Video, it’s the return of everyone’s favorite strong and silent type, Jack Reacher, in Reacher . And on Apple TV+, Mark Wahlberg, Michelle Monaghan, and Maggie Q star in The Family Plan about a man (Wahlberg) trying to keep his past as an assassin hidden from his wife and kids. After six seasons, multiple cast changes, and a gamut of emotions, The Crown is coming to an end at Netflix this week. The show, which has been a flagship series for the streamer, has gone from historical drama to tabloid fodder with the newest season focusing on the death of Princess Diana and the rise of Prince William. The final six episodes came out Thursday, December 14. Like the book series that it’s based on, Prime Video’s Reacher plops it’s main character, retired Army officer Jack Reacher (Alan Ritchson), into different crime-filled situations that he has to resolve using his hulking body and interior monologues. Most of the cast for season two is new, save for Ritchson, and Reacher has moved on from Margrave, Georgia to California where he’s trying to solve the mysterious deaths of members of his old Army unit. (This season will be based on Lee Child’s 11th book in his series, Bad Look and Trouble .) The first three episodes of Reacher season 2 are out now, with new episodes airing weekly. If it’s been a minute since you’ve watched a movie about a retired assassin who’s been forced back into the killer lifestyle despite his attempts to be a normal guy, might we suggest The Family Plan , starring Mark Wahlberg? In the Apple TV+ film, Wahlberg stars as Dan Morgan, a married father of three whose identity as a former government assassin has been discovered by an old foe. In an attempt to protect his family, he takes them on a road trip to Las Vegas where he plans to keep them safe, while fending off the enemy who wants him dead. The options above only scratch the surface, so you know that this weekend’s full lineup will have amazing options for what to watch this weekend!

        "description": "Clearly there are limits to how far China is willing to go in order to foster good relations with its southern neighbor.",
        "content": "Not to be outdone by President Joe Biden’s September trip to Vietnam, Chinese president Xi Jinping paid a much ballyhooed to Hanoi this week. In what the Vietnamese media called “a historic milestone” Xi and his counterpart, Nguyen Phu Trong, General Secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party, signed 36 agreements on a host of cooperative efforts. As Trong , “Vietnam is willing to work with China to build a Vietnam-China community with a shared future that carries strategic significance [and] comprehensively strengthen cooperation in political, economic, trade, security and non-governmental areas.” Indeed, the two leaders reached agreements that ranged from investments in a rail line connecting the two countries to telecommunications to digital cooperation to upgraded security relations. The latter included plans for joint military patrols in the Gulf of Tonkin in the South China Sea and the establishment of a hotline to address “unexpected incidents arising from fisheries activities at sea.” The plans for increased security cooperation actually are little more than an extension of the “Comprehensive Security Partnership” that the two countries established fifteen years ago. The earlier arrangement did little to ease the tensions in relations between the two historic enemies, who and continued to clash along their border and in the South China Sea throughout the 1980s. Neither the normalizing of relations between Beijing and Hanoi in 1991 nor the “Security Partnership” have prevented China from bullying Vietnam in the South China Sea and continuing to assert its to sovereignty over that entire body of water. In 2014, Beijing provoked a major crisis by moving an oil rig into Vietnamese waters. Three years later, it threatened to use force if Vietnam drilled for oil in the South China Sea. China moved a survey ship into Vietnamese waters in 2019, again causing maritime tensions. Addressing Chinese-Vietnamese friction over the South China Sea, Trong stated that “maritime disputes are only part of Vietnam-China relations, and it is believed that the two sides can properly handle them in the spirit of mutual trust and mutual respect.” Yet the good feeling that Xi sought to generate by his visit did not extend to backing away from what China terms its around the sea. Clearly there are limits to how far China is willing to go in order to foster good relations with its southern neighbor. And those limits will continue to create new opportunities for the United States to strengthen its own increasingly improving relations with Vietnam. In the wake of Biden’s September visit, Vietnam now has a “Comprehensive Strategic Partnership” with the United States to go along with its “Comprehensive Security Partnership,” with China. The twinning of these agreements certainly reflects Hanoi’s efforts to maintain a neutral stance between the two superpowers. Nevertheless, Vietnam remains far more wary of Chinese aggression than of U.S. military presence in the region. Hanoi has increased its purchases of American arms and has hosted American warships, most recently when the aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan, accompanied by guided missile cruisers Antietam and Robert Smalls, to Da Nang in July. The Reagan had visited Vietnam the previous year as well, marking the third American aircraft carrier port call in four years. Washington should continue to have its carriers visit Vietnam annually, if not more frequently. Vietnam has committed itself not to host foreign bases on its territory — one of its so-called For that reason, Hanoi will never allow America to base its forces at . Nevertheless, there is considerable room for upgrading American naval activity in the country. In this regard, the expansion of American military presence in Singapore could serve as a model that Vietnam could follow. In 1990, the United States and Singapore first signed a Memorandum of Understanding that enabled U.S. Navy ships to draw upon the facilities at Changi Naval Base. Subsequent agreements expanded the original arrangement, and the Navy now maintains a logistical command unit in Singapore and rotates Littoral Combat Ships and P-8 aircraft from the island. No doubt Beijing would criticize any effort by Hanoi to enhance its security cooperation with the United States. Still, as long as China violates Vietnamese territorial waters while claiming that they actually belong to the Chinese, Vietnam will have good cause to look to America to buttress its deterrent against its powerful northern neighbor. By pursuing an approach similar to that which has been so successful for Singapore, Hanoi could indeed strengthen its deterrent, while Washington could underscore its long-standing policy of maintaining freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, Chinese objections notwithstanding.",

        "content": "Confederation College is doing its part to create a more sustainable future for the next generation of students. Beginning in January, the seven-week Green Energy Micro Credential program will be introduced as a part-time evening class for the very first module titled Net Zero 101 . “We have been talking about a program like this for quite some time,” said Dean John Kantola of the School of Engineering, Technology and Trades at Confederation College. “We have had different technologies embedded or built on the college campus for over a decade. But as things move along [and] time passes, we just haven't had the right opportunity yet to get to where we are today. We are excited that this curriculum being developed can be launched in different capacities and [create] different learning outcomes.” Upon completing the program, the participants will get a badge or a micro credential, which is a digital record of completion. Robyn Gillespie, the manager of applied research and sustainability at the college, noted that students will learn different aspects of green energy. “Specifically in our launch, [students will learn what] net zero is and how to apply that into a real-world setting [while] also understanding carbon and emissions,” Gillespie said Tuesday. “There's some carbon economy pieces [that come] into play [as well as] greenhouse gas emissions scopes. The program is built around working within the facilities at the college and helping to create solutions and understandings that can help us move forward on our goals as well at the college or within a workplace.” Kantola mentioned that analytics has a big role in this venture, adding “We’re excited that our students are sometimes the solutions to many things. If we can utilize their expertise while they're learning here on campus, it doesn't get any better than that.” Other post-secondary institutions have introduced a course similar to this one, but Gillespie notes that the one at Confederation College stands out for many reasons. “We have a northern context which other colleges in Ontario [are] not necessarily providing... We have biomass heating our mainstream building on campus, which is extremely unique in the higher education system. We also have solar, geothermal and wind power as well that we're using; [all of those things are] tied to the Black Pack software that we saw here today that students will have access to within the lab classrooms and certain courses that are being developed,” Gillespie added. The program was launched with a $1.3 million contribution from Natural Resources Canada as well as a two-year pledge of $250,000 from the RBC Foundation through RBC Future Launch.",

        "content": "The firestorm over antisemitism on college campuses may be dying down from its hottest point last week, when congressional questioning of three elite university presidents over their institutions’ responses to antisemitism went viral and resulted in one of them losing her job. But the discord has turned into a lingering debate over free speech on campuses, one that has left experts and scholars worried about its potential chilling effect on dialogue, debate, and education at institutions of higher learning. The debate reached a frenzy after the congressional hearing last week that saw lawmakers grilling the presidents of Harvard, MIT, and the University of Pennsylvania, most notably Rep. Elise Stefanik’s (R-NY) line of questioning on whether calls for the “genocide of Jews” would violate their campus codes of conduct. Though all three had repeatedly assured lawmakers that they hold students accountable for conduct that violates their on bullying, harassment, and intimidation during their nearly five-hour testimony, their answers to Stefanik’s question were essentially the same: It depends. That answer was widely deemed unacceptable by (including the ), prominent alumni, and deep-pocketed university donors, one of whom pulled a to Penn in the intense fallout. Former University of Pennsylvania president Elizabeth Magill, after losing the support of the university board, consequently announced her resignation. Harvard president Claudine Gay , but the university board stood behind her on Tuesday and will allow her to remain in her position. Though some politicians had also called for MIT president Sally Kornbluth’s ouster, she was from the outset. Many of the critics wanted a simple “yes” to Stefanik’s question. But the university presidents could not have given that and still upheld their commitments to free speech. “Without getting greater detail as to what the abstract call for genocide would be and what sort of pattern of conduct or behavior it might be a part of, the college presidents were put in a situation in which they could not answer that question with one word,” said Nico Perrino, executive vice president of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, an organization that advocates for free speech. But they also didn’t communicate what they needed to at a moment of heightened tensions. Their first mistake was failing to challenge the assumption inherent in Stefanik’s question: that their students have already unambiguously called for genocide. Vox spoke with multiple scholars at their schools (and others) who have studied antisemitism and the ; all cast doubt on the idea that students have made any genocidal statements. And though there have been a number of instances in which have been used on campuses, . Knowing that their words would be broadcast across the world, the university presidents might have also done more to empathize with the concerns of Jewish students amid a very real . “They would have been able to get to a lot of the issues that are complex and do involve context. The problem is, you can’t start with that,” said Frederick Lawrence, the former president of Brandeis University and a lecturer at Georgetown Law. “You have to start with a statement that you will protect your students and your staff and your faculty and all the people on your campus.” Their failure to do so ignited calls for their ousting in US media coverage for days, sometimes overshadowing even the actual ongoing war in as the death toll there this week. “I think Magill’s resignation and Gay’s troubles, even if partly self-inflicted, will greatly embolden donors and outside activists who seek to suppress all pro- speech on campuses, not only that which occasionally crosses the line into antisemitism,” said Matt Berkman, an assistant professor of Jewish studies at Oberlin College. What’s happening on college campuses and what went down at the hearing That Stefanik may have been misleading in her characterization of students’ statements shouldn’t obscure the fact that incidents of antisemitism are on the rise on college campuses and across the country. The Anti-Defamation League, a mainstream Jewish pro- group and also one of the US’s leading anti-extremism organizations, that there have been 400 antisemitic incidents on college campuses in the two months following October 7, compared to just 33 incidents reported over the same period a year ago. The Department of Education consequently launched an investigation into , including Harvard and Penn. The ADL told Vox that the incidents it recorded included 98 incidents of harassment, nine incidents of assault, and 49 incidents of vandalism. For instance, two Ohio State students were reportedly called a derogatory term, asked if they were Jewish, and when leaving an off-campus bar in November. A Cornell University student is for allegedly threatening violence against Jewish students in an online forum on campus. And Penn recently to the FBI several “vile, disturbing antisemitic emails” threatening violence against the university’s Jewish community. The university presidents acknowledged in their testimony last week that these kinds of incidents are on the rise, including on their own campuses, and that many of their Jewish students are feeling unsafe as a result. Kornbluth, who is herself Jewish, said that “should trouble every one of us deeply.” They outlined their plans to prevent further such incidents, including creating new task forces and student advisory groups with that mission in mind, increasing campus security, and emphasizing education and community-building around how to fight hate of any kind. “Antisemitism, an old, viral, and pernicious evil, has been steadily rising in our society, and these world events have dramatically accelerated that surge,” Magill said. “This is unacceptable.” Those incidents are clear-cut examples of antisemitism. But during the hearing, Stefanik focused on much more contested examples. She repeatedly pressed the university presidents to agree with her that commonly invoked at pro-Palestinian rallies calling for Palestinian liberation ” and are “ .” She eventually asked the that would trip up the university presidents, “Calling for the genocide of Jews, does that constitute bullying or harassment?” in an apparent reference to those chants. Many pro-Israel activists have argued that these chants are indeed direct appeals to the genocide of Jews and the destruction of Israel. But there’s lots of debate about both phrases. Many in the pro-Palestinian camp, for example, , say they merely express a desire for Palestinian statehood and dignity. This all leads to bigger questions about . The ADL’s report cites 244 rallies on college campuses that included “antisemitic rhetoric, expressions of support for terrorism against the state of Israel and/or anti-Zionism.” But as the ADL makes clear, the . While there can be obvious overlap between the two, critics — including leading liberal and left-leaning Jewish organizations — say it’s to equate any form of opposition to Zionism, a diverse pro-Israel political movement, with hatred of Jews. Doing so, critics say, can also mean shielding Israel from justified criticism and even undermining ADL’s wider anti-extremism work. And as a group of Jewish Democrats in the House recently , it also can flatten “ .” Joel Beinin, a professor of Middle East history at Stanford University who has been critical of some , told Vox that is Arabic for “shaking off” and has come to mean “uprising.” have indeed become violent over time, but the word “doesn’t literally or in usage have anything to do with ‘genocide for Jews’ or anything like that,” he said. “From the river to the sea,” like many protest chants, has had many iterations and meanings over the course of the Palestinian national struggle. Some groups who have called for the violent destruction of Israel, like , have used the phrase. But experts previously told , in the US and other countries where there have been pro-Palestinian protests and calls for ceasefire, the phrase can mean something entirely different. There it might often be a joyous call “for the dignity and full civil rights of Palestinians in their homeland.” It “does not literally mean ‘genocide for Jews,’” Beinin said, noting that the original platform of Israel’s ruling Likud party also demands that “Between the sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty.” “So anyone who thinks it means genocide for Jews if Palestinians say it has to acknowledge that it means genocide for the Palestinians when Likudniks (and those further right) say it,” he said. All of this is to say that references to “intifada” and “from the river to the sea” are far from clear calls to enact genocide against Jews, as Stefanik argued in the hearing. As one Harvard professor who asked not to be identified given the current campus climate told me, “There have been no clear calls for the genocide of Jews at Harvard and I doubt there have been at MIT or the University of Pennsylvania either.” Ultimately, that meant Stefanik’s viral question was just a “red herring,” the professor said, and the university presidents should have acknowledged as much. To the extent that pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian students misunderstand each other on this issue, it is up to universities to “help bridge these gaps by creating supportive environments where students can clarify their meanings and intentions with civility, rather than assuming the absolute worst about one another,” Berkman said. “If they did this, I think you’d find that the overwhelming majority of pro-Palestinian students are not calling for genocide, even if they do call for political outcomes that most supporters of Israel would reject as unacceptable,” he added. “That sort of clarification would in turn help address the anxieties that some Jewish students feel when they encounter pro-Palestinian activism on campus.” However, the university presidents were not just unwilling to challenge Stefanik’s characterization of pro-Palestinian rhetoric as genocidal, but Gay and Magill seemed to support it during the hearing. Gay said that she had heard “thoughtless, reckless, and hateful language” such as “from the river to the sea” and “intifada” on Harvard’s campus and found it “ .” Magill said that calls for global intifada were “very disturbing” and were “at a minimum, hateful speech.” At the same time, all three presidents refused to say that students should be punished for invoking those phrases across the board — only when it rises to the level of harassment, discrimination, or incitement to violence. “I have little doubt that if student activists actually were issuing unequivocal calls for the genocide of Jews on university campuses, they would be swiftly disciplined by their administrations — and rightly so,” Berkman said. “This should have been an easy question for Magill, Kornbluth, and Gay to answer, but because they felt they couldn’t contest the description of pro-Palestinian rhetoric as inherently genocidal, despite knowing that description to be untrue, they ended up looking foolish.” The political motivations at play in the controversy Internal discord at elite institutions and bipartisan doubt about the sanctity of higher education was the outcome that Stefanik and her Republican colleagues wanted — but not because they’re any great defenders of Jews. Stefanik has echoed the that Jews have pushed immigration and multiculturalism as a means of amassing political power over white Americans: In a 2021 campaign ad, she railed against what she characterized as Democrats’ plan to “overthrow our current electorate” by allowing undocumented immigrants to enter the country, leading to . She also continues to uncritically support former , who has associated with including Nick Fuentes and Kanye West. And she and the rest of her party rely on evangelical voters, some of whom await what they believe is the prophesized day when nonbelievers in Jesus, including Jews, will be . So while some Democrats found themselves despite disagreeing with her on practically every other issue, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) reminded them of the absurdity of doing so. “The Republican Party is filled with people who are entangled with antisemitism like that and yet somehow she gets on [her] high horse and lectures a Jewish college president from MIT,” he said during a recent interview on . Stefanik went into the hearing looking for a “gotcha” moment. As she later boasted to the , she had designed her line of questioning in “such a way that the answer is an easy yes” and all three university presidents “blew it” in what she predicted would become the “most viewed congressional testimony in history.” While it’s not clear if that has come to pass, videos of the hearing have gotten to of thousands of views. Stefanik has a complicated history with Harvard in particular. When the Harvard Institute of Politics ousted Stefanik, a Harvard alumnus herself, for supporting Trump’s claims of a stolen , she called it a decision to “ .” Politically, she had every reason to make the university presidents look bad. They represent the same institutions whose perceived liberal excesses her party railed against for years. Her questions were part of Republicans’ long-running war on higher education that has included ending in college admissions, thwarting Biden’s forgiveness plan, and cracking down on the teaching of “critical race theory,” as well as proposals to , end the , and eliminate universities’ . Other GOP lawmakers made the connection explicit during the hearing. Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC) used her question time to rail against Harvard coursework and seminars focusing on racism and social justice, which she said fosters a culture in which “you have faculty and students who hate Jews, hate Israel, and are comfortable apologizing for terror.” Republicans see political opportunity there. As GOP pollster Robert Cahaly recently , the party may be able to paint the pro-Palestinian views of young people as the “price for having the next generation taught a bunch of nonsense.” Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC) lamented during his question time in the hearing, “I think this [hearing] is so sadly and shamefully revealing that there’s no diversity, inclusion of intellectual thought,” meaning the teaching of conservative ideology on college campuses. “And the result of that is antisemitism.” It’s an idea that has proved resonant with their base. Only 19 percent of Republicans said in a that they have “a great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in higher education. Republicans have also sought to use the issue of antisemitism — both on campus and in the country more broadly — to turn the tables on Democrats, who have sought to highlight the extremism of the MAGA movement under Trump. After right-wing white supremacists chanted “ ” at a rally in Charlottesville in 2017, Democrats accused Republicans of failing to reckon with extremism and antisemitism in their own ranks. Now, Republicans feel that they have the opportunity to say the same of Democrats, while simultaneously working to weaponize real Jewish fear and make themselves look like the party most willing to keep Jewish people safe, on college campuses and everywhere else. Last week’s hearing proved an opportunity to flex that strategy. What this means for college campuses and broader discourse on the war So, where does all of this leave universities and the acrimonious discourse over the war in Gaza playing out on their campuses? Lawrence, the former Brandeis president, worries that the backlash to the university presidents’ testimony could further erode trust in higher education, which was among all Americans. “What I fear is that this enrages more people about higher education. They feel higher education is out of touch on issues that they care about. That would be a terrible outcome,” he said. It could also cause universities to roll back their commitments to free speech, which they see as essential to how they approach education. “I think that there is a concern at any particular moment of heightened fear that that could be an overreaction,” Lawrence said. In dealing with the current environment, he says that universities should approach incendiary speech on their campuses as falling into three buckets, the first being a small number of “genuine, bona fide threats of violence and threatening behavior” that would warrant punishment or even referrals to the criminal system, such as the recent incident in which a Cornell student was charged. The second is speech that is protected by the First Amendment but that is sufficiently problematic that the university should make a very clear statement about why it is contrary to the values of the university. For example, Yale president Peter Salovey recently that “Chants or messages that express hatred, celebrate the killing of civilians, or contain calls for genocide of any group are utterly against our ideals and certainly are not characteristic of our broader community.” Those kind of statements “do have an impact on the campus community,” Lawrence said. The third, which Lawrence said is the “largest by far of all the forms of expression,” is the kind of speech that, whether smart or based on naivete or ignorance, should always be met with education. “So a school like the University of Pennsylvania, for example — which has outstanding faculty in international relations and social psychology and a whole set of related fields — ought to be putting on programs throughout campus, open sessions, town hall meetings, webinars, all the different ways in which we educate students.” But even in this framework, universities may have to permit students to engage in speech that many would find abhorrent — potentially including, as the university presidents sought to acknowledge in their testimony, abstract calls for genocide, Perrino, the free speech advocate from FIRE, argued. “There may be some circumstances where an abstract call for genocide is part of a pattern of behavior that meets the legal standards for peer-on-peer discriminatory harassment,” Perrino said, noting that such speech is not protected by the First Amendment and would warrant that a university take action against it. But there are other situations, he argued, where a call for genocide might constitute protected speech. He cited one 2018 case in which a Drexel University professor was investigated for tweeting, “ .” On its face, that was a call for genocide. “But context does matter. He was making a joke about white nationalists’ theory of white replacement theory. He was a white guy. The tweet wasn’t targeted at anyone. It was simply satire,” Perrino said. That’s why free speech advocates like Perrino have advocated against universities implementing speech codes, which he says would be “wielded by those in power arbitrarily and in a political way” — including potentially against those they were originally designed to protect. “If the allegation is that all these college administrators are enabling antisemitism, do you really want to give those same college administrators the power to wield a broad speech code?” he asked. However, that hasn’t stopped the board of Penn’s Wharton business school from to the university code of conduct that go beyond existing university policies and include prohibitions on “language that threatens the physical safety of community members” and “hate speech, whether veiled or explicit, that incites violence.” Supporters of the changes have argued for a fundamental recalibration of private universities’ approach to free speech: Penn law and philosophy professor Claire Finkelstein, for instance, in the Washington Post arguing that universities should “rethink the role that open expression and academic freedom play in the educational mission” in order to protect their students. But critics of such speech codes — such as , the director of free expression and education programs at the free speech advocacy organization PEN America — warn that the “vague” provisions proposed by the Wharton board threaten to “ban wide swaths of speech.” Perrino argued that if anything will prevent genocide, it is the protection of individual rights including free speech. “The erosion of individual rights is necessary to allow the sort of horrors that the people who are calling for more speech codes fear. So it’s very short-sighted to erode civil liberties,” he said. That’s especially the case when the humanitarian situation in Gaza is becoming more dire every day — a subject that has been given short shrift while Americans have focused on debating how they should be allowed to talk about it.",

        "description": "The final trilogue meeting is scheduled for December 15. Here we explore who's pushing for more surveillance on journalists and what's at stake.",
        "content": "France, Italy and Greece are some of the seven countries pushing for enabling authorities to spy on journalists in case of national security, a new investigation has revealed. First published in September last year, the EU Media Freedom Act aims to bolster the independence and pluralism of the media sector in Europe. Yet, some commentators fear that without the right wording and provisions the new law will de-facto achieve the opposite results. Today, December 15, the EU Commission is holding what expected to be the final round of talks (trilogue) which it may seen the hardliner governments find a compromise with other members. As mentioned, the EU Media Freedom Act comes as an attempt to set some rules to ensure and protect media freedom and pluralism across the Union. It comes following concerns about a highly politicized media landscape. For this, it includes safeguards against political interference in editorial decisions and the use of spyware against journalists , a framework for transparency, increased protection of journalistic sources, and more. Despite its intentions being good and well-needed, the ongoing negotiations seems to have been shaping the law with some controversial clauses which are worrying commentators. \"The EU Media Freedom Act (EMFA), though well-intended, has significant flaws,\" wrote digital rights advocates at Electronic Frontier Foundation on December 6, commenting on a proposed special status for big media outlets whose content cannot be removed from big tech platforms. Another even more contentious point is then around the use of surveillance tools against journalists. Born as a way to make the practice illegal following high profile cases across Europe, some countries keep pushing for a \"national security\" clause (Article 4). According to Reporters without Borders , this is \"dangerous provision, which would poison the law from within.\" While the infamous Article 4 and the \"national security\" exemption is nothing new—it was added to the text in June, in fact—new revelations shed some light on those countries lobbying together to legitimize this type of state surveillance. A joint-investigation among three EU media outlets (Investigate Europe, French non-profit Disclose and Holland-based Follow the Money) revealed that France , Greece , Italy , Cyprus , Finland , Sweden and Malta are the seven governments still pushing to allow spyware use against journalists despite the wave of criticism across the industry. According to a document obtained by the media consortium which was written by a high-ranking German official present at the last trilogue on November 22, Italy expressed the strongest stances deeming the additional paragraph a \"must and red line.\" France, Finland and Cyprus said to be \"not very flexible\" on the issue. While, Sweden, Malta and Greece agreed \"with some nuances.\" \"Governments have no business being on journalists’ phones. We in the European Parliament have made provisions for this. It is unacceptable that member states are now trying to reintroduce this snooping paragraph through the back door,\" said one of the negotiators, German Green MEP Daniel Freund, to Investigate Europe. 🇪🇺#EU: IPI is concerned by revelations that #France, #Italy #Greece & other governments are pushing for loopholes for 'national security' regarding the surveillance of journalists amidst the final stages of EU negotiations on the #EuropeanMediaFreedomAct.https://t.co/55LpBzPJBR December 12, 2023 The biggest fear here is that such a provision will de-facto legitimize the unlawful use of Pegasus and Predator spyware against journalists, which has already occurred in Greece, Spain, Bulgaria and Hungary. These governments have all previously played the national security card to justify their actions. Before the latest revelations, 17 European media organizations signed an open letter calling for \"adopting robust wording in the final version.\" They wrote: \"We are deeply concerned about the chilling effect that could ensue if the final text sets conditions for disclosure of sources that fall short of international human rights standards and maintains the paragraph ‘This article is without prejudice to the Member States’ responsibility for safeguarding national security’. \"The EU has always been a stronghold of media freedom and pluralism, but today these central values are in decline. Where the rule of law is undermined, media freedom is often the first casualty.\" At the time of writing, representatives of EU member states are discussing these two very distinct lines on this thorny issue. We don't know which of the two will prevail eventually, but most likely the hardliners will need to find a compromise with the other states. Whether that will be enough to truly protect media freedom and journalists' privacy in Europe is yet to be seen.",

        "content": "The vice president of Total War studio Creative Assembly, Roger Collum, has released a lengthy statement apologizing to the strategy series’ fans for its “mistakes when it comes to our relationship with you all.” He outlined the studio’s plans to improve the poorly received Warhammer 3 DLC, Shadows of Change , delay the upcoming Thrones of Decay DLC, and alter the pricing of Total War: Pharaoh . In the statement , which was published yesterday (December 14), Collum said that “it has been a difficult few months,” and the studio has been engaged in “constant conversation internally on how we can get back to solid ground.” He noted: “We see the confusion, the frustration, and the distrust of us across the community and honestly, it breaks our hearts. We make games to bring you joy, to inspire a love of history, of fantasy, and strategy games. Total War is our everything, we care about it as deeply as you. Recently, it’s clear that we have failed to demonstrate that in our actions.” As Eurogamer reports , Total War: Warhammer 3’s Shadow’s of Change DLC was released in August, and currently sits on Steam with a ‘Mostly Negative’ user rating. Collum has now acknowledged that “we failed to meet your expectations of what a DLC should be,” and stated that Creative Assembly is working on a major free update which it hopes to release in February 2024 (although he noted that this window could change). The studio has committed to \"ensuring that we better meet your expectations going forward.\" Furthermore, as a result of this update, but also “to make sure that we don’t repeat our past mistakes, and to give you the amount of content that you rightly expect from us at these price points,” the Total War: Warhammer 3 Thrones of Decay DLC is being delayed to 2024, with the aim of launching it in April. It was originally supposed to launch before the end of 2023. Otherwise, Total War: Pharaoh , which was released in September, has been given a permanent price cut, taking it from $59.99 (£49.99) to $39.99 ($29.99). A FAQ section explaining the matter simply states that the team thought that this price was “fairer” - existing owners will receive partial refunds to make up the difference. Furthermore, the pricey Deluxe and Dynasty editions have been removed from sale, and Pharaoh ’s first paid DLC will now be a free update, set to release in early 2024. “We again apologize for the missteps we’ve made,” Collum concluded. “The mistakes of Total War are a shared responsibility by all the leaders of the franchise, and while it may not seem like it at times, we are listening.” Looking for some new game recommendations?

        "description": "Beeper Mini is having more problems, and Apple's getting blamed. But it's not like this is a huge surprise.",
        "content": "The saga of Beeper Mini continues as the iMessage workaround for Android devices has seemingly gone offline for the second time in the space of a week. Apparently this new wave of connectivity issues has affected around 5% of users, and Beeper Mini itself has been quick to pin the blame on Apple. The app claims that Apple is “deliberately blocking iMessage from being delivered.\" The Beeper X account has also been complaining about Apple’s efforts to block the services, stating that “it’s super annoying that Apple is penalizing their own customers and Android users who just want secure and encrypted chats.“ Adding, “we understand if you choose to uninstall Beeper Mini at this time.\" We realize how incredibly inconvenient this is for you. It's super annoying that Apple is penalizing their own customers and Android users who just want secure and encrypted chats. We understand if you choose to uninstall Beeper Mini at this time. Hope to have you back soon. December 14, 2023 But let’s be honest here; this doesn’t come as a huge surprise. Apple has already blocked the first loophole Beeper Mini utilized to access iMessage, and it was only a matter of time before the current workaround got targeted as well. It’s just surprising that this issue is only affecting a handful of users, rather than Beeper Mini as a whole. Not to mention the fact that this service is primarily aimed at Android users, and Apple has a long history of trying to pretend they don’t exist. So the comments about penalizing Apple’s own customers don’t make a lot of sense. It’s true that Apple has effectively crippled inter-platform communication up to this point by defaulting back to SMS and MMS when communicating with non-Apple devices. Both those systems are ancient from a tech standpoint, and have problems and restrictions that make the user experience less than ideal. Like character limits, file size limits and the lack of any kind of encryption. But this criticism has been leveled at Apple for years, and might finally be solved with the adoption of RCS in 2024 . The current system is still in use, and rather a bad look for Apple, but at least we know it’s on the way out. Apple has also claimed that apps trying to reverse engineer their way into iMessage pose a threat to user security and privacy. Beeper Mini denies this, claiming that it actually increases security , but after the allegations leveled against Songbird and Nothing Chats , it’s clear we shouldn’t take these sorts of claims at face value. Beeper Mini claims that it will continue working to get its Android app working with iMessage again, with particular emphasis on restoring phone number support — something Apple managed to block late last week. In the meantime, if you’re that concerned about the state of inter-platform communications, you can always try and convince your iPhone-toting friend to sign up for one of the best encrypted messaging apps . You know, the ones that have been around for quite some time and are typically free of controversy.",

        "content": "Besides the Gemini Nano-powered Summarize on the 8 Pro, the latest Recorder update adds “Transcribe again” to other Pixel devices. Transcribe again lets you get a transcript in languages that aren’t currently supported by Pixel Recorder’s Live Transcription capability. After launching from the overflow menu of a previous session, select one of the available languages : It works by uploading that audio recording to Google’s servers. The company tells us that standard Google text-to-speech is being used here. This process takes a good minute or two and you’ll see a “Processing” card noting the status of the transcription. In our testing, you can’t use Transcribe again on something that already has a transcript in hopes of improving the quality. Version 4.2.20231031 of Recorder has widely rolled out. The previous Recorder update in October added the ability to favorite/star recordings, Audio channel (mono or stereo) selection, and a “Detect language’ capability for Speaker Labels.

        "description": "Partly thanks to remote work and education, most printers on sale became compatible with the now-ubiquitous Chromebook.",
        "content": "Once you’ve picked out one of the , you need some accessories to go with it. While a Chromebook comes with all the essentials, you’re likely to need a printer for it at some point. While many reports and documents are fine to be emailed, every once in a while, you’ll need to print something out. Printing may not be an everyday occurrence any more for many of us but who wants to have to go to a store to get it arranged at the last minute? Being able to print from home is so much more convenient. Finding a Chromebook-compatible printer isn’t as tricky as it sounds with the only distinction being that ChromeOS can’t print over Bluetooth. Everything else is free game though with Wi-Fi, USB, or wired LAN working just fine, and most printers working with a Chromebook right out of the box. With many printers for Chromebooks around, we’ve tracked down all the best printers for Chromebooks, based on expert opinion. We’ve considered that some of you may need a budget option while others want something much more high-end. As with any tech purchase, it’s important to consider your budget and needs when picking out a printer for Chromebook. There’s no one size fits all solution although there are definitely a handful that should appeal to the majority of people. Have a think about what you plan to use the printer for. Are you looking to solely print black and white documents or do you want to print photos too? Do you need it to be fast or is that not a priority? Do you need scanning functionality? Think about all these things before you dive into considering which printer to buy. Not everyone needs the as these are only appealing if you plan on also scanning documents as well as printing them. For some people, one of the will be just fine as they’re relatively inexpensive, low-maintenance and work just fine for printing out documents. Generally, you can pick one of the and you’ll be happy but there’s no point buying one packed with features that you don’t need. Printers range from being incredibly cheap at sub-$50 prices to costing hundreds of dollars. Not everyone needs to spend the price of a Chromebook on a printer but you might. If you’re planning on printing hundreds of pages every month, you don’t want to scrimp on a printer that will slow you down. That’s where it’s important to think about the features you want along with how much you can afford to spend. We’ve picked out printers that will work with ChromeOS and Chromebooks with the vast majority of printers doing so these days. However, you may have a specific connection in mind. If you want to hook it up directly to your network, check the printer has a wired LAN port. Alternatively, check for a Wi-Fi connection if you’re fine to go wireless or look for USB if that’s your need. When picking out the best Chromebook printers, we considered a handful of key factors. We looked at price while still appreciating that some people are willing to pay a lot for something high-end. We also considered reliability given no one wants a temperamental printer at a key time. We also looked at useful features such as how fast it can print, what it’s capable of printing of, and if it has any additional features that make it stand out from the crowd. We’ve used a lot of printers over the years spanning many different brands and features, such as regular inkjet printers right up to all-in-one solutions so we know what to look for in a printer that people genuinely want to use on a daily basis. If you work from home or even if you’re part of a small office setup, the Brother MFC-L3720CDW is highly capable of keeping up with your busy working life. It can print at up to 19 pages per minute as well as scan incredibly quickly too. To speed things up further, it has a 50-page auto document feeder so you can easily set up multi-page copy, scan, and fax jobs. A 250-sheet capacity paper tray makes it perfect for setting aside rather than needing by your side too. While it could be complicated, the Brother MFC-L3720CDW is actually very simple to use. That’s thanks to its 3.5-inch color touchscreen which has access to 48 custom shortcuts to simplify the process. You can easily connect the printer to popular cloud-based apps like Google Drive, Dropbox, Evernote, and OneNote, so it lends itself well to your cloud living life with a Chromebook. Plenty of connections are available with built-in dual band wireless along with Wi-Fi Direct, or you can always hook up the Brother MFC-L3720CDW directly via a USB 2.0 port. Brother is one of the best printer brands around and very highly respected for its reliability, especially when it comes to laser printing. It’s versatile stuff although potentially overkill if you just want to occasionally print a document. The beauty of laser printers is that they’re so much more reliable than an inkjet printer. They tend to cost more too as the HP Color LaserJet Pro 4201dw demonstrates but they’re a fantastic investment if you want something that won’t let you down for a long time. This model is designed with a small team in mind but what’s your household at heart, right? It’s incredibly fast being capable of printing up to 35 color pages per minute. Image quality is exceptional too as you’d expect with sharp detail and gorgeous colors too. If you’re printing hundreds of pages per month, this sped makes a huge difference. There’s also auto two-sided printing so all you need to do is fill the 50-sheet multipurpose tray and 250-sheet paper tray and you’re good to go. Via the wireless printing functionality, you can easily print from your Chromebook along with pretty much all other devices you can think of. The Epson Workforce WF-7840 has the right name being highly capable for work purposes. It’s an all-in-one solution so it can print pretty fast with up to 25 black pages or up to 12 color pages per minute. Results look great too thanks to accurate dot placement and instant-dry pigment inks that ensure professional-quality prints. It’s simple to use too with a 4.3-inch color touchscreen making it easy to find what you want to do. The Epson Smart Panel app works from your phone too if you want further control but simple wireless setup means you’re good to go whatever your plans. The Epson Workforce WF-7840 is also a scanner so you can easily copy documents while a large 500-sheet paper capacity spread across two 250-sheet trays and a 50-sheet rear tray all prove super convenient. If you only plan on printing the occasional document, the HP ENVY 6065e will suffice. It’s very simple to set up with a smart control panel ideal for direct printing or options via the HP Smart app. It also has useful features like self-healing Wi-Fi so it’s capable of automatically detecting and resolving connectivity issues to cut down on interruptions. While the HP ENVY 6065e isn’t exactly fast, it does have extras like automatic two-sided printing which makes things far more convenient for you. As standard, it prints at just seven pages per minute in color or 10 pages per minute in black and white, but that’s just fine for occasional usage where time isn’t essential. The HP ENVY 6065e is also a scanner capable of scanning up to 1200 x 1200 dpi as well as copying up to 300 x 300 dpi, so it’s good for a little bit of everything. A 100-sheet input tray and 25-sheet output tray means no need to keep too close to it while you work. The Canon PIXMA MG3620 isn’t the most exciting of printers to use but it’s a good option for those with limited space at home and not wishing to spend too much. It can print two-sided documents which is a useful time saver, although it can only print just 10 pages per minute in black and white or 5.7 pages per minute in color. Besides printing, the Canon PIXMA MG3620 is also a scanner so there’s no need to find room for an additional device in your limited home office storage space. The Canon PIXMA MG3620 works well wirelessly both thanks to Wi-Fi support and extensive app support, so it’s useful for more than just your Chromebook. If you want something straightforward if uneventful, the Canon PIXMA MG3620 will do the job well. Understandably, high print quality isn’t cheap. The Epson EcoTank ET-15000 is a big investment but it’s equally capable of some pretty large prints with the chance to print up to 13 x 19 inches. Print quality is truly stunning thanks to the use of a high density print chip which generates up to 40 million dots per second with some truly gorgeous accuracy. Versatile paper handling means you can print those extra large prints with the rear feed while there’s copy and scan support for up to 8.5 x 11 inches via the scan bed or 8.5 x 14 inches via the automatic document feeder. A 2.7-inch color touchscreen means you always know what’s going on while — of course — there’s wireless support. For a lot of people, the Epson EcoTank ET-15000 is going to be too much. Some people will have a Chromebook cheaper than this printer but if you plan on printing a lot of images and you want them at your best, you’ll love the Epson EcoTank ET-15000. Perfectly suited for extensive document printing, the Epson WorkForce Pro WF-3820 is a little slow with color prints but offers a speedy 25 pages per minute in black and white. Thanks to Epson’s PrecisionCore Heat-Free technology, you get a particularly fast first-page out along with reliable printing and reduced downtime too. There’s also high-precision printing with accurate dot placement and instant-dry pigment inks for professional-quality levels with your documents. To make things even simpler for you, there’s also auto two-sided printing along with one-sided 35-page automatic document feeder to help you go even faster with less effort. Everything about the Epson WorkForce Pro WF-3820 is simple to use so it’s an ideal addition to your home. Well regarded across the board, it’s not going to let you down. In a dorm room with your trusty Chromebook? Add on the HP DeskJet 2734e and you’ll be all set for printing out whatever needs printing. It’s certainly slow at just 7.5 pages per minute in mono or 5.5 pages in color, but it’s just fine for the occasional print out. That’s reflected by its fairly small yet functional 60-sheet input tray and 25-sheet output tray. The HP DeskJet 2734e is also a scanner and copier. Again, it’s not exactly speedy or packed with features but it’s just right for occasional tasks. There’s wireless and mobile printing support, while the HP DeskJet 2734e’s dual-band Wi-Fi has a self-reset feature if there’s a problem. Look out for the fact that the HP DeskJet 2734e won’t work with non-HP cartridges but other than that, it’s a good basic model for the most minimal of requirements.",

        "content": "On the latest episode of 83 Weeks, Eric Bischoff talked about the success that WWE has found over the last year, trust the company has with CM Punk, and more. You can check out some highlights below: On the most crucial thing behind WWE’s boom in popularity: ‘Discipline, structured story and character development. And I would disagree to a degree with the person who posed that question. I think the Bloodline storyline, which started long before Vince left and was getting very exciting long before Vince left, Vince was very much a part of that storyline. And perhaps in some ways, at some points, he held it back. Maybe it could have gotten bigger, faster, stronger sooner. But Vince was very, very much a part of that. Vince’s [McMahon] commitment to Roman Reigns; let’s go back now three, four, five years. Vince was determined to get Roman Reigns over. So people could say, ‘Oh yeah, as soon as Vince left, everything got better.’ It’s not a very realistic perspective. “Yeah, I think things have gotten better better since Vince left. Only because I think the creative process is now much more efficient. I think your writing team can now, with confidence, start laying out stories without knowing in the back of their mind, in the front of the mind that there’s about a 75% chance, even though Vince would say, ‘Yeah, that looks good’ on Friday on the plane, going to Raw on Monday morning he might just tear the whole thing up and start over again. That’s a very, very uneasy feeling if you’re a creative person. And then you get to the building and you’re going to know that you’re going to have two hours to write a brand new show from top to bottom that has to be approved. Not only does it have to be approved, if there is a spelling error in the first draft of what you think you want to do and you want to present to Vince with only two hours before show time. But if he sees a typo or poor grammar, there’s a chance he’ll just rip the whole thing up without the rest of it, and ask you to go redo it. And let you know what he thinks of your grammar and your spelling on your way out the door. That’s not efficient creative. And it takes a creative person so outside of their game and the train of thought, the frame of mind, the vibe they have to be in, it’s just it’s a different world being in creative. And to have that kind of instability throughout the entire process doesn’t get you to the best creativity by any stretch of the imagination.” On whether WWE trusts Punk enough to make him World Champion: “You know, I don’t know the culture that exists today. I knew the culture that existed last time I was there. I was in — and I’m going to be very vague, but I’m doing it intentionally out of respect, so please accept that. But I was in a meeting, Punk’s name came up, and all of the key decision-makers in WWE at that time were in that meeting. And that name came up, and the conversation lasted all of three minutes. And that was the end of that. That was the culture then. I don’t know what the culture is now. You know, Triple H used to work for me, Paul Levesque worked for WCW before he went to WWE but I never got to know Paul then, a couple of conversations with him really. Even when I worked with him when I first went to WWE as a talent, very little conversation with Paul Levesque. When I worked there in 2019 for a cup of coffee, I interfaced with Paul Levesque more than I ever had in the previous 20 years. But even then, I didn’t really get to know him. So I don’t know what Paul thinks, and what his tolerance is for situations like CM Punk brings. “I suspect that — two things. One is, I don’t think CM Punk’s going to even try to exert the kind of — I’m going to call it bullying, right? He ain’t throwing his weight around backstage at WWE anywhere. The company is so much bigger than him, there’s no room for that there, and nobody will tolerate it. And I think because of history, people will be watching very carefully how Phil Brooks as an individual handles himself professionally behind — because there’s no question the CM Punk character is viable and valuable. The question mark is, is Phil Brooks the professional that he needs to be to make it work? I suspect he probably is. I suspect that, I hope, that Phil Brooks is going, ‘Wow, this is a hell of an opportunity. I can write the end of my own story. I can retire from this business on a positive note. And oh by the way, I can pocket millions and millions of dollars along the way. But I gotta be a team player.’ That’s what I hope, and that’s what I think is probably going on: he’s a smart guy. He has to be a smart guy to get where he is right now. But I do think that there’s probably eyes on Phil Brooks and the way he conducts himself. But I don’t know where the guardrails are, but I don’t think it’s going to be an issue, I really don’t. I said this before he even went there when speculation was, ‘Do you think he’ll go?’ I said, ‘Sure, he’ll go. If he has the opportunity, he’d be crazy not to.’ But he’s not going to get away — there is no CM Punk running amok backstage. No one’s going to get choked out. No one’s going to be in fear for their life. You’re not going to have the craziness and the mishegoss going on backstage and the drama that went on in AEW because it’s an entirely different environment.” If you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit 83 Weeks with an h/t to 411mania.com for the transcription.",

        "content": "Neil Magny isn’t typically one to get caught up in trash talk. The UFC welterweight division’s all-time leader in wins last fought in a short-notice affair at UFC 292 in August. Magny filled in for his fellow veteran Geoff Neal to face rising undefeated Irish star Ian Machado Garry . Unfortunately for the 36-year-old, he was dealt an 11th career loss in his 39 outings when Garry won a one-sided unanimous decision. In the very brief build-up to the bout, Garry (13-0) targeted Magny personally, and specifically went after a comment Magny made towards Garry, saying he’d give him “a whooping that you give your son.” Garry ran with it and went on to call Magny an abusive father and state how such contexts shouldn’t be used and are never funny. Since then, Garry has pulled out of his upcoming fight at UFC 296 that was scheduled for tomorrow night against Vicente Luque . “The Future” has cited pneumonia as the reason for his withdrawal . The timing is brutal for Garry within the community, not only with it coming after his verbal attack on Magny, but drama has followed the Irishman in the form of a gym departure and a resurfacing of a controversial book published by his wife Layla Anna-Lee. Therefore, the online backlash has to have made Garry already hesitant about his public obligations before his fight was canceled. Despite their history, Magny isn’t at all basking in the fallout. “I’m fortunate now that like the majority of that stuff is behind me,” Magny told Middle Easy . “That didn’t affect me too drastically when it comes to my family life and that kind of thing. But, it’s unfortunate to see someone’s personal life be drug up the way his life has been drug up and all the stuff that he has to go through currently. I wouldn’t wish that on anybody, especially when you consider the entire family dynamic and all the people are involved in there. “Like yeah, him and his wife may have whatever going on, but at the end of the day, regardless of what’s going on, they share a child together. That child deserves the right to grow up knowing he has two loving parents or whatever. Again, all this stuff drug out into the media, out in the open, that kind of thing — I don’t think anyone is deserving of that regardless what they may or may not have done to me. I’m not gonna sit back and necessarily take joy in seeing that play out with somebody.” Garry’s win over Magny was his biggest to date and his sixth straight in the octagon. It’s unknown at this time whether or not the matchup with Luque will be rebooked as Kevin Holland has teased the possibility of taking Garry’s place. Magny, on the other hand, will look to rebound sooner rather than later when he faces Mike Mallott at UFC 297 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on January 20. Ideally, “The Haitian Sensation” will one day score a rematch with Garry, but he won’t hold his breath. “If I’m being honest, it’s unfortunate,” Magny continued to reflect on his brief saga with Garry. “Having gone through what I got gone through based off of some of the statements and antics that Ian Garry said during fight week, it definitely caused some personal turbulence in my life, so to speak. But at the end of the day, I have to take accountability for the things that left my mouth and take accountability for the words that left my mouth. I definitely made statements that he was able to spin and play out in a different way than what I have intended to. “At the end of the day, that’s on me. I was the one who made those statements, made those statements publicly. How someone else perceived them or spun them — that’s outta my control, but I kind of gave him that opportunity to be able to do so. I have to own that fact and live with it, so to speak.” Finale.

        "description": "It’s a social issue, in part, but it’s also becoming a biological issue as the percentage of deer harvested by archery in some Badlands hunting units approaches the percentage of deer taken by gun.",
        "content": "Growing up in western North Dakota, Angelo Vournas developed a passion for archery hunting in the Badlands at an early age. “My mom would call into school at noon and say I was sick, so I’d go down to the Badlands my senior year,” said Vournas, who graduated from high school in Williston, attended college at UND and now lives in Minot. “I spent a lot of time down there.” Then as now, the vast amount of public land available in the Badlands of western North Dakota and the potential for shooting a trophy mule deer buck with his bow were big attractions, Vournas says.

You can get off trail and not have to worry about people, typically.” ADVERTISEMENT The “not have to worry about people” part of the attraction has started to change in recent years as more people discover the Badlands and what it has to offer. That includes not only deer hunting, but sharp-tailed grouse hunting, hiking, biking and other outdoor recreational activities. But it’s the deer hunting pressure that has had perhaps the greatest impact on the experience, Vournas and others say. It’s gotten to the point, Vournas says, where he doesn’t even hunt the September archery opener anymore, “just because of the amount of people that are down there.” Many of those people, he says, are hunters, often from out of state, who may not understand how to pursue deer in the rugged Badlands environment. Vournas prefers the “spot-and-stalk” technique, glassing the horizon with binoculars in hopes of spotting a mule deer bedded down and then making a slow, stealthy pursuit that can take hours. “A lot of people just go walking around with their bows thinking they’re going to shoot a mule deer,” he said. “What they don’t realize is that they’re probably not going to shoot a mule deer and they’re screwing it up for everybody else who is trying to (spot) one and then be able to make a stalk on it.” In response to the uptick in Badlands traffic and calls from the public, the North Dakota Game and Fish Department is exploring options for managing the situation. “We’ve been hearing from the public for the last few years a bit more, I would say,” said Bill Haase, assistant wildlife chief for Game and Fish in Bismarck. “Especially from archery hunters. The hunting pressure is taking away from the quality of the hunt. And then from the gun hunters – they’re getting frustrated because it’s more and more difficult to draw that coveted (mule deer) gun tag.” Allocating licenses Game and Fish sets mule deer gun licenses based on population surveys, which gives them the flexibility to adjust tag numbers as necessary, but archery licenses are trickier because the regulations are in state law. North Dakota residents can buy archery tags basically over the counter, allowing them to hunt anywhere in the state and shoot either white-tailed or mule deer. ADVERTISEMENT There’s no limit on the number of whitetail-only bow licenses available to nonresidents, but nonresident “any-deer” archery tags – allowing the harvest of either a mule deer or a whitetail – are limited, by state law, to 15% of the previous year’s mule deer rifle tag allocation. Nonresident archery tags cost $250. It’s a social issue, in part, Haase says, but it’s also becoming a biological issue as the percentage of deer harvested by archery in some Badlands hunting units approaches the percentage of deer taken by gun. “The success rate in archery hunters the last few years has been anywhere from 9% to 15%, so it’s low,” Haase said. “It’s tough to shoot a deer in the Badlands with a bow, but the effort is really high. So, when you have a lot of people doing it, it starts to add up to a meaningful harvest.” Throw in a lower mule deer population, the result of poor fawn production after severe drought in 2021 and consecutive harsh winters in 2022 and 2023, and the issue becomes even more pronounced. Mule deer populations in the Badlands have declined from more than 10 deer per square mile to “probably below six,” Haase said in November during a livestream of the Game and Fish Department’s fall advisory board meeting in Bismarck. In this screen shot, Bill Haase, assistant wildlife chief for the North Dakota Game and Fish Department, discusses hunting issues Tuesday, Nov. 21, 2023, during the Game and Fish Department's District 7 fall Advisory Board meeting in Bismarck. The meeting was livestreamed on the Game and Fish Department website. Contributed / North Dakota Game and Fish Department Fawn production last spring was the lowest ever recorded, “and that’s concerning for us,” Haase told the Herald. “It’s been kind of a tough go here for a while, and our numbers have dropped – our densities are lower out there,” Haase said in an interview. “They’re OK – it’s not like we’re not going to recover from it. They’re down, but not drastically down because we’ve been very conservative with our gun tag allocation.” In 2023, Game and Fish offered 862 nonresident “any deer” bow licenses statewide. In response to the population decline, the department drastically cut mule deer gun licenses in 2023 – 2,250, compared with 5,750 in 2022 – but this year’s nonresident “any deer” bow tag allocation was higher than it should have been, Haase says, because of the state law requiring that nonresident any-deer bow licenses be set at 15% of the previous year’s mule deer gun tag allocation. ADVERTISEMENT Contributed / North Dakota Game and Fish Department Next year, nonresident “any deer” bow tags will “drop dramatically,” Haase said, because fewer mule deer gun licenses were available this year. “It’ll be a big drop (in 2024) because it’s a year delay on that, and so that’s kind of unfortunate,” he said. “We’re not able to be as reactive with that (nonresident “any deer” archery) tag allocation as it should be.” The past three years, Haase says, Game and Fish has expanded its post-hunting season archery surveys in an effort to learn more about where bowhunters are going and whether certain times of archery season are busier than others. “We found it’s busy, and it’s busy throughout the season,” he said. Tackling the issue In an effort to gain even more insight into the Badlands issue, Game and Fish last spring assembled a three-person “Badlands License Working Group,” which included a representative from the North Dakota Bowhunters Association, a representative from the North Dakota Chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers and a certified Pope and Young scorer with ties to landowners and the Mule Deer Foundation. The group met twice in the spring and early summer, said Brock Wahl of Bismarck, co-chairman of the North Dakota Backcountry Hunters and Anglers chapter who was part of the group. Brock Wahl of Bismarck, co-chairman of the North Dakota Chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. Contributed / Backcountry Hunters and Anglers “In those meetings, we went over some of the data that Game and Fish had – what they’re seeing with that data, what they’re hearing from hunters, and some of that is just what’s going on in the rumor mill,” Wahl said. “Is there a lot of people concerned about it, or is it just a few people, or what’s going on – is it rifle hunters, bowhunters, landowners – what’s happening here?” In response to those meetings, Game and Fish contracted with a Colorado firm, HDNR Consulting LLC, to develop a survey, which was sent in September to a random sample of 8,000 North Dakota resident deer hunters. ADVERTISEMENT Out of those 8,000 hunters, more than 4,000 responded, and Game and Fish is in the early stages of analyzing the report, which is about 55 pages long, Haase says. “One of the takeaways was that the majority of people are interested in some type of specific management of these archery licenses,” Haase said. “It’s certainly something that we’re going to look at (for) nonresidents and residents,” in terms of how archery licenses are allocated. One thing’s for sure: Whatever changes ultimately result – if any – won’t be to everyone’s liking. “No matter what we do, I can assure you not everybody will agree with us,” Haase said. “There’s people on each end and everywhere across the middle. And there’s a lot of different ways to go, so it’s tough.” Max Hoefs of Grand Forks, who moved to North Dakota from Minnesota in the early 2000s, says he’s been hunting the Badlands since about 2006 and so far this year has spent about three weeks in the rugged country trying to fill his archery tag. “I fell in love with the Western-type of hunting; the spot-and stalk part of it is a little more challenging than sitting in a tree stand for whitetails,” he said. “Sitting on a nice butte, sitting on a nice hillside with a good pair of binoculars and just enjoying nature and looking for a good mule deer. … That’s how I fell in love with the out-West (style of hunting).” Like other resident archery hunters, Hoefs says he appreciates being able to purchase a license every year. On one hand, Hoefs says, he’d like to see fewer nonresident archery hunters in the Badlands – or perhaps even none – but understands the revenue that nonresident license fees bring to the Game and Fish Department. “I’d be really sad as a North Dakota resident not being able to bow hunt in the state” every year, Hoefs said. “But if it was proven that, ‘Hey, if we do this, if we cut the number of tags back, the deer population (and) the success rate would be better,’ would I be for it? Honestly, I don’t know.” ADVERTISEMENT The broad range of opinions definitely adds to the challenge, says Wahl of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. “Everybody’s got an opinion about what’s going to work and what’s best for them. And I’m no different,” Wahl said. “I have my own biases, and I think the challenging thing for us as a chapter is this is going to be a difficult issue for us to really come out strong in support of one particular idea or concept because, with social issues, you’re going to have a lot of unique and passionate opinions. Everybody has their opinion of what’s best. And so as an organization, it would be very difficult for us to come out really strong in support of something and expect that all of our membership is going to be in unified agreement with that.” What’s next Once Game and Fish has analyzed the survey results, the department will meet in January with the Badlands License Working Group and hold public meetings around the state sometime in February or March to gather additional input, said Haase, the assistant wildlife chief. Whatever regulation changes are implemented for next fall, if any, will have to be included in the proclamation of proposed 2024 big game hunting regulations due at the governor’s office in mid-April, Haase said. Others would require legislative action because they’re in state law. “We don’t have to do everything this year,” he said. “Maybe we’ll implement some things this year and then analyze, see what happens and then adjust accordingly. “I don’t know yet, we’ll see. We haven’t made any determinations.” Change is often difficult, and this process is no different, Wahl said. “What we’re talking about here is changing a really long history of the way things have been done in North Dakota,” Wahl said. “And whether or not there’s going to be a change, I don’t know at this point. But I do think when you’re talking about these hunting traditions, tag allocation and season setting, those are tied to our traditions, and so anytime you’re talking about a change like this, which could affect archery and rifle seasons and how often you get to go hunting with certain weapons, that’s a big deal.

        "description": "Duluth native Jake Willis takes over as the Minnesota DNR's chief pilot.",
        "content": "GRAND RAPIDS — Chris Lofstuen retired from his dream job as a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources pilot last week. Lofstuen, of Duluth Township, had been the DNR’s chief pilot since 2019. He didn’t want to leave his passion for being a flying game warden in the rearview mirror. But he says he feels pretty good about the fact the job is now in the hands of a good cop, a good pilot and a good friend. Duluth native Jake Willis has taken over as the chief DNR pilot, heading the agency’s aviation unit based out of Grand Rapids. Willis, 43, and Lofstuen, 57, have been buddies for years. Jake Willis, the new chief pilot for the Minnesota DNR's aviaton unit, during a patrol flight. Sky wardens like Willis conduct routine patrols and also work with wardens on the ground to locate illegal activities, such as baiting for deer or destroying wetlands, that may be out of view of officers on the ground. Contributed / Jake Willis Willis, an avid outdoorsman, is a Duluth native and Superior High School graduate who went from being a Duluth city (and previously University of Minnesota Duluth) cop to game warden, trading his urban beat for a backwoods patrol. Before accepting the chief pilot job, Willis had patrolled the woods and waters of the Brookston station just outside Duluth since 2018. On the ground, as a fully licensed police officer — as all state conservation officers are — Willis may respond to a drunken driver call one hour, illegal spruce tree cutting the next and then reports of a dead bear struck by a car, all between his contacts with hunters and anglers. ADVERTISEMENT But now he’s also going to be in charge of the DNR’s aviation unit, carrying on a tradition that started in 1947. One of two original Minnesota DNR game warden pilots, John Parker, a World War II veteran who started flying for the DNR in 1947. Parker was stationed in Warroad. Contributed / Minnesota DNR “It’s become a pretty important part of what (DNR) is trying to accomplish,” Lofstuen said of the aviation unit. “Not just natural resource protection and management, but public safety in some pretty remote places.” A broad mission in the air Aviation unit pilots over the years have conducted a huge variety of missions — everything from keeping an eye on hunters and anglers, searching for and rescuing lost or injured people, and even ferrying out dead bodies from hard-to-reach locations. Those historic missions continue today with added duties of stocking fish in remote lakes, monitoring wildfires, conducting aerial surveys for wildlife research — waterfowl, elk, moose, deer, wolves and more. They also conduct surveys of how many anglers — boats in summer, ice houses in winter — are fishing on a given lake on a given day, part of the DNR’s creel survey efforts to determine how much fishing pressure is happening on any given body of water.

While the pilots are officially part of the DNR's law enforcement division, much of their work involves fish and wildlife research. Contributed / Quintin R. Slade / Minnesota DNR “The majority of our time in the air really isn’t for law enforcement. It’s primarily a lot of research work with some public safety mixed in,” Lofstuen noted. But even while working on aerial surveys for wildlife research, DNR warden pilots can help make a bust. From the air, the DNR pilots are able to see things that officers on the ground can’t — like a backhoe illegally altering a stream a mile from the nearest road or a deer hunter with a pile of illegal bait on a big chunk of private property.

While the DNR aviation unit is officially part of the enforcement division, the pilots spend much of their time performing fish, wildlife and other natural resource jobs in the air. Contributed / Minnesota DNR Willis recalls one case early in his DNR career when he was flying with an aviation unit pilot on another mission when they noticed a pile of bright orange pumpkins piled along a field, not far from a deer stand. “Corn and pumpkins show up like a beacon from the air,” Willis noted. “We marked it with a GPS pin and finished what we were doing that day. … And on opening morning (of deer hunting season), I walked in there, much to the guy’s surprise. He couldn’t figure out how I knew the bait was there because I hadn’t even walked over to it yet.” ADVERTISEMENT Subscribers Only Northland Outdoors ALSO READ: Carlton County conservation officer follows in grandfather's footsteps Cloquet native Mikeena Wehr returns home to patrol the same woods and waters that Lee Alderson covered. Oct 20 · By John Myers Some hunters intent on breaking the law will go to great lengths to hide their illicit acts. Some DNR pilots have reported camouflage netting strung over bait piles. Willis and Lofstuen noted that some hunters have even painted white PVC pipe to look like a birch tree, and then filled it with corn so only a small amount comes out the bottom — like an automatic pet or livestock feeder. At night, thieves stealing spruce tops or birch trees off public or private land tend to work in the dark. But DNR pilots generally fly low and slow enough to see whatever doesn’t look quite right on the ground. “If something is happening way back on a piece of private property, they can see that from the air. I could legally walk in there. We have that right. But I’m probably not going to go in unless I’m sure there is something going on,” Willis noted. “When we see it from the air, we know for sure.” Duluth-area Conservation Officer Kipp Duncan said DNR pilots often see things while conducting fish or wildlife surveys that they pass on to wardens on the ground, one cop’s tip to another, that often help in making a case. In other cases, the cooperation is more direct. “In one shining case (using a floodlight or vehicle light to shine deer to shoot at night) I had, they directed me right to the guy who still had the light on and a loaded gun in his hands,” Duncan noted.

He said he loved his previous job as a sex crimes investigator for the Duluth Police Department and was reluctant to leave. But the chance to combine three of his passions with the DNR job — flying, the outdoors and law enforcement — was too good to turn down. Both Lofstuen and Willis have been pilots since they were 18. ADVERTISEMENT Willis received his degree in law enforcement and aviation from Minnesota State University-Mankato. His goal had been to become a commercial airline pilot. But the cost and time it took to train for that job seemed out of reach. Instead, Willis became a cop, first for the University of Minnesota Duluth and then the Duluth Police Department. He slowly left his passion for flying behind. That is until Lofstuen coaxed him into a ride out of the Two Harbors airport on Lofstuen’s private plane. The love of flying “immediately came right back to me when I went up with Chris. I went right out and got current (with his private pilot's license requirements) after that,” Willis said. “I missed it that much and didn't know it.” DNR pilots Jake Willis, left, and Chris Lofstuen at Lofstuen's retirement party in the DNR hangar at the Grand Rapids/Itasca County Airport on Dec. 1. John Myers / Duluth Media Group Lofstuen had dreamed of a career as a corporate pilot flying bigwigs around in Gulfstream jets. That never happened, and instead, the Bloomington, Minnesota, native ended up as a police officer. But he never stopped flying. “Before I wanted to be a cop, I wanted to be a pilot. This job let me do both,” Lofstuen said of his DNR gig. “Once you get into public service like this, it’s a big part of who you are.” In recent years, Willis has been flying part time for DNR in addition to his field station work on the ground. When Lofstuen was forced to retire due to a medical issue that ended his piloting days — after 32 years in law enforcement, including 10 years as a flying warden with DNR — Willis was encouraged to apply for the job. “I probably won’t be flying any more than I was before because a big part of the chief pilot job is administrative,” said Willis, who did get a nice bump to the rank of captain. Aviation unit started with WWII vets Two of the aviation unit’s first pilots, Robert Hodge and John Parker, were recently inducted into the Minnesota Aviation Hall. Both men flew in the military during World War II and, in 1947, joined what then was the Minnesota Department of Conservation, Hodge in the Ely area and Parker at Warroad. The unit started with two planes and not much direction. One of two original Minnesota DNR aviation unit pilots, Robert Hodge was stationed in Ely starting in 1947. Contributed / Minnesota DNR “Before the era of GPS, we often didn’t know where these guys were or what they were doing,” Lofstuen noted. ADVERTISEMENT There currently are five pilots — including Willis — in the unit who are also licensed conservation officers and two others who are “natural resource” pilots who are not officers. Combined, they may fly over 2,000 hours for the DNR in a year. The Minnesota DNR's aviation unit has a mix of small aircraft used to conduct various natural-resource-focused missions across the entire state. Contributed / Minnesota DNR Lofstuen said it’s important that as many DNR pilots as possible are licensed officers who are trained in police work. “It’s essentially a flying police officer. And we see things other people might miss that might be important in the investigation,” Lofstuen noted. The DNR aircraft — planes and helicopters — and their pilots are stationed in Bemidji, Brainerd, Grand Rapids and Mankato but end up flying over all areas of the state. Those aircraft can take off and land not just from any airport in the state, but some are fitted with floats for summer lake work and then skis for winter. Willis has spent much of his time in a two-seat American Champion Scout, a tiny plane that is perfect for low-level reconnaissance. Another workhorse of the DNR fleet is the Cessna 185, including one stationed in Grand Rapids that has floats and wheels. Minnesota game wardens use both planes and helicopters to patrol the skies. Contributed / Minnesota DNR The aviation unit covers the entire state, especially for fish and wildlife missions like elk surveys in the far northwestern corner of the state and moose surveys in the far northeast. But the focus often is on state-managed lands, including 75 state parks, 1,300 miles of trails, 3,000 public access lakes and rivers and some 5 million acres of state forest. \"We try to prioritize what is pretty expensive flight time,\" Lofstuen said. \"Are we going to land that float plane on a lake to check one angler for a fishing license? That's probably not the best use of taxpayers' money when someone can do it from a boat. So we focus on the higher value things we can do.\" The DNR pilots spend most of their time flying low and slow, which requires constant attention to flying as well as whatever they are monitoring on the ground. A special waiver from the Federal Aviation Administration allows them to fly as low as 100 feet. They don’t often fly much at night or in bad weather, but all of the DNR pilots must be instrument-rated to fly in all kinds of Minnesota conditions. ADVERTISEMENT A historic photo of a Minnesota DNR aviation unit float plane on the job. Contributed / Minnesota DNR It has sometimes been dangerous work. In June 1999, Grant Coyour of Bemidji — a veteran DNR conservation officer and pilot — and a student biologist were killed when their 1977 Piper Cub airplane crashed into a bog during a moose survey in the Red Lake Wildlife Management Area south of Baudette. Next year, the aviation unit will take delivery of a new Cessna 206, a turbocharged single-engine aircraft that will be fitted with the latest in infrared and night vision sensing and photography technology aimed at helping in wildlife surveys. In other states, the same technology has been used to survey wildlife as small as grouse and as large as elk, Lofstuen noted. The technology can also be used to map wildfires at night, showing the size and footprint of the fire and locating where any hotspots may be. There’s even a laser option that can be used to direct wardens on the ground to a specific location. “In some sense, we’re using the same technology we were back in 1947… a pair of binoculars and a pilot looking out the window,” Lofstuen said, noting that conducting elk surveys, for example, requires the pilot to fly not much higher than tree-top altitude. The new technology will be safer and more accurate, he noted. “This is going to bring us into the modern era and really expand what we can do from the air.” more by john myers Subscribers Only Minnesota Video captures firefighters' harrowing dog rescue in Duluth Ship Canal Duluth firefighters climbed into 8-foot waves rolling in off Lake Superior to rescue a dog that had escaped its owner and leash 3d ago · By John Myers Subscribers Only Northland Outdoors Rural Duluth man may be the best wildlife artist you've never heard of Dec 8 · By John Myers Northland Outdoors Angry deer hunters rally against wolves, DNR, Democrats Dec 7 · By John Myers Subscribers Only Northland Outdoors More chronic wasting disease found in Minnesota deer Nov 30 · By John Myers Comments Share Share this article News reporting News reporting Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.

        "content": "Nick Kyrgios is famous for his controversial opinions. Recently, Kyrgios has been involved in a social media spat with tennis legend Boris Becker. During his X feud with Becker, Nick Kyrgios even got into an altercation with a tennis fan. Advertisement The Australian was responding to Becker and took a shot at the former World No.1 by suggesting he has an ego issue. Kyrgios claimed that he will not compare himself with the new generation of players after next 20-30 years. This tweet was met with different sort of responses but one reply stood out. Advertisement Nick Kyrgios and Boris Becker’s row on X is showing no signs of stopping. Both the tennis superstars are going back and forth at each other with their different opinions. Both the tennis stars have big personalities, which could only escalate the feud more. How did the Nick Kyrgios and Boris Becker feud begin? In an interview, Nick Kyrgios claimed that the older generation of players cannot compete with the new generation. The Australian believed that the like of Novak Djokovic would have easily beaten players like Pete Sampras and Boris Becker at their peaks. However, these comments did not go well with Boris Becker. Boris Becker claimed Nick Kyrgios make a lot of noise. Becker, who is co-incidentally also the former coach of Novak Djokovic, was unhappy with Kyrgios comparing the older generation of players like Rod Laver, Bjorn Borg, and John McEnroe, among others to the current generation. Becker even took a shot at Kyrgios for controversially having an OnlyFans account. It will be interesting to see how long this feud between these two big tennis personalities last for.",

        "content": "Mats Zuccarello and Matt Boldy scored in the shootout to lift the Minnesota Wild over the Calgary Flames 3-2 on Thursday night. Boldy and Marco Rossi scored in regulation for Minnesota, which is now 6-2 since John Hynes took over as coach for Dean Evason. Filip Gustavsson stopped 36 shots in goal for the Wild. \"It's just good to win,\" Boldy said. \"You've got a group of guys that work hard every night. Lotta desperation to win to get that kind of streak going and stuff like that, so a lot of credit to other guys.\" Yegor Sharangovich and Blake Coleman scored, while Dan Vladar made 30 saves for the Flames, who are 1-5-1 in their last seven games. MORE: St. Croix Lutheran Academy's Laura Hauge breaks state 3-pointer record Sharangovich also scored in the shootout, but Gustavsson stopped Nazem Kadri as the fourth shooter to preserve the win. \"This was a good game, probably for both sides, I would say,\" Calgary coach Ryan Huska said. \"I thought we had a slow first 10 minutes but then I liked our game from that point forward. I felt like we deserved the extra point tonight.\" Boldy has seven goals and two assists in the eight games since Hynes took control. He scored his eighth goal of the season in the first period. Sharangovich is on his own scoring streak, scoring for the fourth straight game. He scored on the power play in the second, giving him five goals in the past four games. Calgary took a lead in the third when Coleman's pass to Sharangovich went off defenseman Brock Faber's skate and into the goal. Coleman was credited with his ninth goal of the season and it was the sixth short-handed goal of the season for the Flames, which is tied for the third-most in the NHL. But Minnesota answered just 45 seconds later when Rossi one-timed a long rebound from Vladar to score for the second game in a row. Rossi has 10 goals, which is second behind Connor Bedard among NHL rookies. \"I didn't really hit it good,\" Rossi said. \"I fanned on it, but I'll take that.\" Both teams were missing important pieces of their defensive core. MORE: Red Bull Heavy Metal to bring street snowboarding event to St. Paul in February Minnesota placed Jonas Brodin on long-term injured reserve a day earlier with an upper-body injury and captain Jared Spurgeon was held out with a lower-body injury. Brodin was seen in pictures on social media with a cast on his right wrist/arm at a team function. Spurgeon is considered day-to-day. \"Thought it was a really strong team game for us,\" Hynes said. \"Injuries are part of the league. When you can play a really compact, strong team game, it gives you the best chance to win. Our D-core played really well, we played well as a five-man unit. I think when you can play with structure, everybody contributes, it gives you a chance to win.\" Chris Tanev, an assistant captain for Calgary, missed his second straight game with an upper-body injury and is considered day-to-day.

        "content": "Fanatics Sportsbook NJ is officially headed to the Garden State. Following the brand’s acquisition of PointsBet Sportsbook ‘s U.S. assets in June of 2023, PointsBet New Jersey is set to transition to Fanatics Sportsbook New Jersey in the early stages of 2024. Once the brand makes its debut in the state, a special welcome offer will be available to new users who register for an account using the Fanatics Sportsbook New Jersey promo code . Read on for more details regarding Fanatics Sportsbook New Jersey. We discuss its potential welcome bonus for new users, the features that help it compete in the legal sports betting industry , and other details about one of the fastest-rising sportsbooks on the market. Fanatics Sportsbook NJ is not currently available, but we expect a launch to happen in early 2024. Earlier this fall, CEO Michael Rubin said that the operator would go live in the biggest sports betting states during football season. Some of the other states expected to acquire the brand’s services include New York , Pennsylvania , Connecticut , and Michigan . As far as a launch date goes, we anticipate Fanatics Sportsbook NJ’s arrival sometime in early 2024. There have been some rumblings about states surrounding NJ launching the platform during the NFL season, which is now down to just December 2023 and January 2024. So, while there is nothing official, the clues tell us it could be sooner rather than later. The fact that Fanatics Sportsbook NJ is transitioning from PointsBet NJ should help expedite the process. Since Fanatics Sportsbook NJ is not yet live, there is no active promo code or welcome offer associated with it. We expect the welcome offer to be similar to the one currently live in the brand’s other active states. That offer allows users to Bet $10+ Over 5 Days, and Get $200 in Bonus Bets. If the operator implements the welcome offer in New Jersey the same way it does in other states, users won’t need a promo code at all.

We also discuss how to deposit funds and start playing so you can make the most of your welcome bonus. Most likely, you won’t need a promo code to claim the welcome offer at Fanatics Sportsbook NJ. This prediction stems from the fact that the operator provides its welcome offer to users in other states upon signup. So, simply click the links on this page to create an account and make qualifying wagers to receive your bonus once the operator goes live in the Garden State. Once your Fanatics Sportsbook NJ account is verified and approved, you’ll need to deposit funds to start betting and claim your bonus.

Keep in mind that some deposit methods may have associated fees or processing times, so check the terms for each option. After completing the deposit, your account balance will reflect the deposited amount, and you can begin placing bets. You’ll have to deposit at least $10 to take advantage of the projected Bet $10+ for 5 Days, Get $200 in Bonus Bets welcome offer. Betting $10 per day translates to $40 in bonus bets per day. If you bet $10 each day over five days, you’ll need to deposit $50 and you’ll end up with a total of $200 in bonus bets. Fanatics Sportsbook NJ may require you to place wagers to get bonus bets. You can qualify for the operator’s welcome offer by participating in a range of ways to play that cater to both casual bettors and seasoned enthusiasts: Traditional pre-game betting is the most prevalent and straightforward form of sports betting. It revolves around predicting the outcome of a sporting event before it commences. Users engage in this process by scrutinizing the sportsbook’s odds, assessing potential outcomes such as victory, defeat, or a draw, and placing their bets accordingly. Examples of traditional pre-game bets encompass predicting the winner of a basketball game, estimating the total number of goals in a soccer match, or wagering on the point spread in a football game. Bettors who strategically place such wagers well in advance of the event may factor in considerations such as team statistics and player performance into their decision-making process. Live in-play betting is a dynamic facet of the sports betting world. It unfolds while a sporting event is in progress, enabling users to place bets on various outcomes and events during the game. The process involves users getting access to continuously updated odds based on the current situation as the game evolves. Users can engage in real-time betting on dynamic markets, such as predicting the next team to score, the outcome of the next play, or the total points in a quarter. Examples of live in-play bets include wagering on which team will score the next goal in a soccer match, predicting the outcome of the next drive in a football game, or betting on the winner of the next set in a tennis match. A parlay , also known as an accumulator or a combo bet, involves consolidating multiple individual bets into a single wager. All included bets must be successful for a parlay to win. In the parlay process, users select two or more separate bets and combine them into a single bet slip, with the odds for each selection being multiplied to determine the potential payout. While parlays present the allure of higher potential payouts due to the increased risk of multiple correct bets, they also entail a greater risk of losing, as every component must win for the overall bet to succeed. Prop bets, or proposition bets, introduce a unique dimension to sports betting by allowing users to bet on specific events or outcomes within a game that may not directly impact the final result. The process involves sportsbooks offering a diverse range of prop bets, spanning from predicting player performances (e.g., total yards a quarterback will throw) to specific occurrences (e.g., which team scores first). Examples of prop bets include wagering on the number of three-pointers a basketball player will make, predicting the player to score the first touchdown in a football game, or betting on the duration of the national anthem at a sporting event. These bets contribute diversity and entertainment to sports betting, enabling users to engage with specific elements of a game beyond merely predicting the final score. Here’s what to expect from the Fanatics Sportsbook NJ mobile app . As with any online sports betting platform , user experience can vary, so it can be helpful to understand the app’s strengths and weaknesses. Here’s an overview of the betting markets and bet types available at Fanatics Sportsbook NJ: Placing bets responsibly is crucial to ensure an enjoyable and sustainable sports betting experience.

Fanatics Sportsbook New Jersey will have a refer-a-friend program available to its existing users.

DiNucci’s elevation was tied to an offer he received earlier this season. Chris Tomasson of the reports that the Saints wanted to sign DiNucci to their active roster, but he passed on the chance in order to stay on Denver’s practice squad because the Saints were only looking for someone until Jake Haener returned from a suspension. DiNucci confirmed the interest without naming the team this week and explained why he wanted to stay put. “There was a point in the season where another team had ,’’ DiNucci said. “I didn’t necessarily want to go. I didn’t necessarily want to be jumping around during the middle of the season. For quarterbacks, it’s tough. This is my first year [with the Broncos]. I want to be in the system and learn. I had a lot invested in this place.” Signing with the Saints would have guaranteed DiNucci three game checks on the active roster and he said the Broncos “told me they’d make it up to me by the end of the year.” The December 3 elevation brought him one game check and DiNucci expects to be elevated two more times in the final four weeks of the season.",

        "content": "After two demanding years navigating the Formula 1 track, has finally secured a win. However, this victory doesn’t unfold on the racecourse but extends into a different realm. , Hamilton has transitioned into the world of skillfully producing high-quality non-alcoholic spirits and those efforts have now received accolades. Advertisement In a recent declaration, Lewis Hamilton has secured the esteemed Benvet Spirit Awards for his outstanding non-alcoholic spirit. This recognition underscores Hamilton’s groundbreaking entry into the non-alcoholic sector, partnering with the inventive Mexican spirits company, Casa Lumbre. Interestingly this brand is spearheading the category with an alternative spirit that retains the traditional ingredients and processes of tequila which is a rarity in the market. However, the centerpiece of this innovative movement is Almave, an exceptional creation crafted in partnership with the F1 champion Lewis Hamilton. Advertisement Notably, Almave distinguishes itself by incorporating cooked and distilled agave, paying homage to the authentic origins of tequila. Nevertheless, what sets it apart is its departure from the usual fermentation process, allowing this tequila counterpart to preserve the genuine essence of agave without the accompanying intoxicating effects. Certainly, upon receiving the award, fans must have recalled Hamilton’s initial description of the non-alcoholic beverage. In an interview with Robb Report, the seven-time champion passionately expressed how this innovative drink would introduce a unique and refreshing taste for individuals. What prompted Lewis Hamilton to venture into the non-alcoholic spirits industry? Lewis Hamilton consistently displays a visionary approach, gaining renown not only in racing but also in diverse businesses, including the NFL and soccer. However, his latest venture takes a unique turn into crafting non-alcoholic beverages. Considering his varied ventures, one may wonder what prompted the British ace to step into the non-alcoholic industry. Advertisement The primary answer lies in the industry’s burgeoning growth. According to Nielsen, non-alcoholic drink sales in the United States surged to $395 million between August 2021 and August 2022, marking a substantial 20% increase over the year. Another substantial reason behind introducing the drink is the increasing preference for sober lifestyles and conscientious drinking, exemplified by Hamilton himself. In recent years, as the 38-year-old has aged and maintained a commitment to excellence, he has placed a greater emphasis on his well-being. To achieve this, he embraced a plant-based diet, inspired by the numerous health and environmental benefits it offers. Nevertheless, despite the shift towards healthier choices, Hamilton maintained a consistent habit as an enthusiastic drinker, a practice he initiated at the age of 16. According to Hamilton, this aspect of his lifestyle appears inconsistent with the rest of his highly focused persona. Considering this, the British athlete mentioned in a interview, However, as he concluded, the seven-time champion clarified that his decision to prioritize well-being was more important to him than consuming alcohol.

        "content": "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) knew that America’s meat industry had a drug problem. For decades, evidence had amassed that the widespread use of antibiotics to make livestock grow faster — and survive the crowded, unsanitary conditions of factory farms — was causing bacteria to mutate and develop resistance to antibiotics used in human medicine. Over time, once easily treatable human infections, such as urinary tract infections and tuberculosis, became to treat. A foundational component of modern medicine was starting to crumble. But it wasn’t until the mid-2010s that the FDA finally took the basic steps of requiring farmers to get veterinary prescriptions for antibiotics and banning the use of antibiotics to make animals grow faster — steps that some European regulators had taken a decade or more prior. Thanks to those two actions alone, sales of medically important antibiotics for livestock plummeted 42 percent from 2015 to 2017. But in a concerning course reversal, antibiotic sales for use in livestock have ticked back up, increasing 12 percent from 2017 to 2022, per a new . Sales increased 4 percent in 2022 alone. In 2022, the chicken industry’s antibiotics purchasing slightly declined, but in every other major sector — cattle, pork, and turkey — antibiotic sales rose. “Antibiotic sales to meat producers continue to increase despite efforts that the FDA has made,” Louis Sokolow, a policy associate with Frontier Group, a public health and sustainability research organization, told Vox. “The status quo of these small increases year over year is not enough to protect people from antibiotic-resistant bacteria.” According to an published in September by the Natural Resources Defense Council and One Health Trust, medically important antibiotics are increasingly going to livestock instead of humans. In 2017, the meat industry purchased 62 percent of the US supply. By 2020, it rose to 69 percent. It’s a sobering turn of events with life-and-death implications. In 2019, antibiotic-resistant bacteria directly killed over globally, including , and more than 5 million others across the world died from diseases where antibiotic resistance played a role — far more than the global toll of HIV/AIDS or malaria, leading the World Health Organization to antibiotic resistance “one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today.” Public health advocates want to see the FDA take the threat much more seriously, and often point to Europe as a . From 2011 to 2022, antibiotic sales for use in livestock fell across the European Union, and use per animal is now that of the US. Last year, the EU implemented perhaps its most significant reform yet: banning the routine use of antibiotics to prevent disease, reserving their use for only when animals are actually sick. It’s unlikely the FDA will follow in Europe’s footsteps any time soon. Asked about an EU-style ban on preventive use of antibiotics, an FDA spokesperson responded, “The laws in the US and our livestock population are not the same as that of the EU or other countries. The FDA’s initiatives to promote judicious use and reduce AMR [antimicrobial resistance] were devised specifically for the US and the conditions we face with the aim of maximizing effectiveness and cooperation of drug sponsors, veterinarians, and animal producers.” The FDA and the US food industry have proven that they can make progress on the issue — but to keep antibiotics working, they need to do a lot more. That will require them to tackle beef and pork, two of the more stubborn and complex sectors of America’s meat system that just can’t seem to quit antibiotics, since doing so could demand substantive changes to how animals are farmed for food. The American antibiotic-free revolution that wasn’t It wasn’t just the FDA’s new rules that caused antibiotic sales for livestock to plunge in a two-year period — Big Chicken played a part too. In the early 2000s, the nation’s fourth-largest chicken producer began efforts to wean its birds off antibiotics, which it achieved in 2016 by changing chickens’ diets and replacing antibiotics with vaccines and probiotics. At first, chicken raised without antibiotics cost 50 percent more, but the company says it has since been able to all but close the cost differential. In the mid-2010s, while Perdue was making progress, activists leveraged the momentum and McDonald’s to source chicken raised without medically important antibiotics which contributed to a domino effect in which producers and restaurants made further pledges to reduce antibiotics in poultry. By 2020, a little of America’s 9 billion chickens farmed for meat were raised without antibiotics, according to an . The sea change in chicken production demonstrated it was possible to quickly scale down antibiotics in farming, but it didn’t do much to reduce overall use, as the chicken industry only used 6 percent of antibiotics in agriculture in 2016. And the momentum didn’t spread to other parts of the meat business, like beef and pork, which together account for over of medically important antibiotics fed to farmed animals. Some of the lack of progress in beef and pork comes down to the simple fact that pigs and cattle are raised differently than chickens. Chickens are slaughtered at just six or seven weeks old, so the chance they’ll get sick is lower than pigs, who are slaughtered at six months old, or cattle, slaughtered at around three years of age. The chicken industry is also vertically integrated, meaning a company like Tyson or Perdue controls virtually every link in the supply chain, so making big changes like cutting out antibiotics is easier than in the more decentralized supply chain of beef. For example, the typical steer will change hands several times before slaughter, going from a breeder to pasture grazing to a feedlot, all of which make it harder to coordinate an antibiotic-free regimen. In the last few months of their life cattle are also fed a high-grain diet that they aren’t adapted to digest, which increases the chance they’ll develop a , a condition that’s prevented with antibiotics. The pork sector, like poultry, is also vertically integrated, but the industry has largely opposed , , and reforms. Antibiotics in pig production shot up from 2017 to 2022. There’s also no pork or beef giant that’s taken the antibiotic-free leap like Perdue did for chicken. That could change in the years ahead: McDonald’s, the world’s largest beef purchaser, at the end of 2022 that it plans to reduce antibiotic use in its beef supply chain. However, the announcement didn’t come with a timeline, which . Although voluntary change can move the needle, without regulation, industry has little incentive to make the dramatic reductions needed to safeguard antibiotics. While the FDA has prohibited meat producers from using antibiotics to speed up growth— their in agriculture — some of the that , like tylosin, are still allowed for disease prevention. Matthew Wellington, formerly of the Public Interest Research Group, or PIRG, told Vox this is a that disincentivizes producers from reducing antibiotics: “Our concern has always been that they’re just putting a different name on the same kind of use, which is a problem.” (This story was originally published in January 2023; Wellington has since left PIRG). In response to this concern, an FDA spokesperson said, “Veterinarians are on the front lines and as prescribers, they’re in the best position to ensure that both medically important and non-medically important antimicrobials are being used appropriately.” Aside from outright banning the routine use of medically important antibiotics to prevent disease, PIRG would like to see the FDA take three actions: set a target of reducing antibiotic use by 50 percent by the end of 2025 (based on 2010 levels); publish data on antibiotic use, not just sales; and limit the duration of antibiotic courses for farmed animals. An FDA spokesperson said specific reduction targets weren’t possible because the agency doesn’t know how many antibiotics farmers are using: “We cannot effectively monitor antimicrobial use without first putting a system in place for determining [a] baseline and assessing trends over time.” The agency right now only collects sales data, and it’s been exploring a to collect and report real-world use data. Some states haven’t waited on federal regulators: have both restricted the use of antibiotics on farms. How the Europeans — and some Americans — are quitting antibiotics on the farm Just because it’s difficult to reduce antibiotics in beef and pork production doesn’t mean it’s impossible, as the story of Iowa pig farmers Tim and Deleana Roseland demonstrates. In 2005, they switched from raising pigs in the conventional manner — tightly cramped and fed a steady diet of antibiotics — to raising pigs for Niman Ranch, a higher-welfare meat company now owned by Perdue. That required the Roselands to ditch the routine use of antibiotics. “I was nervous about it at first but as it turned out, it was no big deal whatsoever,” Tim Roseland said. But he added that it wouldn’t have been possible with his old setup: “There’s too much overcrowding, small pens, too many pigs crammed into a little area.” Their newer system gives each pig more space in larger pens, and bedding that they root through and chew on, instead of, when they’re packed into factory farms, chewing on each other. They also give the pigs more vaccines and feed them probiotics. And there’s a lot to learn from Denmark, Europe’s pork producer. From 1992 to 2008, antibiotic use per pig fell by over 50 percent, and while pig mortality went up in the short term, by 2008 it had dropped back to near-1992 levels. The small country’s transformation wasn’t a matter of rocket science, but a suite of smart : more frequent barn cleaning, better ventilation, later piglet weaning, more space per pig, , and experimenting with feed and additives. All this comes with difficult tradeoffs: antibiotic-free pork costs more and requires more land, which increases its carbon footprint. But we can’t expect to have cheap meat forever without a cost to public health, an uncomfortable truth that’s led many environmental and public health groups to champion a message of meat. “I think the fact that Denmark, despite very low antibiotic use since 1995, is still one of the biggest pork exporters in the world, already speaks for itself,” said Francesca Chiara, a director at the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. Given the of global antibiotic sales for agriculture, Denmark’s example may not be speaking loudly enough. But it’s time we listen — nothing less than the future of human medicine is at stake.",

        "description": "For the first time in almost 75 years, beavers were released into California waters as a part of conservation efforts by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and Maidu Summit Consortium.",
        "content": "December 15, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread by Emma Hall, The Sacramento Bee For the first time in almost 75 years, beavers were released into California waters as a part of conservation efforts by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and Maidu Summit Consortium. A family of seven beavers swam their way through Tásmam Koyóm, a tribal community in Plumas County that are ancestral land to the Mountain Maidu people. This new family will join a \"single resident beaver in the valley\" with the goal to re-establish a breeding population, according to the CDFW. Ben Cunningham, chairman of the Maidu Summit Consortium, said the valley had beavers years ago, but due to pioneer interference, the population disappeared. \"It's good to have them back home again,\" said Cunningham, who is also Northeastern Maidu. \"The beavers are back where they belong.\" Not only will these beavers be important for local tribes and groups like the Maidu Summit Consortium, but broader conservation efforts. Beavers are what CDFW Environmental Program Manager Valerie Cook called \"keystone species.\" Beavers, she said, provide a significant ecological benefit to their landscape, species around them, and help build up climate change resilience. Removal can be detrimental to a local ecosystem. \"There's a cascade of effects where you see (once beavers are gone), other species are no longer there,\" Cook said. \"Beavers really play a critical ecosystem management role.\" Described as an \"ecosystem restoration tool,\" Cook said the beavers are vital to engineering aquatic habitats. Having beavers in the area can lead to increased groundwater recharge and increased seasonal water flow. Rather than spend millions of dollar on ecosystem restoration efforts that include mimicry like beaver dam analogs, beavers can do their part. \"This new opportunity to have beavers translocated into restoration efforts is truly a nature-based solution where we can bring them in and just let them do the work. Let them do their thing,\" Cook said. \"Let them play their role in the ecosystem. The CDFW said their efforts will continue in the spring on the Tule River Reservation, which is located in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains. Charlton H. Bonhom, the director of CDFW, said this project is the product of leadership from local tribal communities. If it weren't for communities like the Tule River Tribe of California or other tribes, he said, an effort like this wouldn't be possible. \"We would not be here without the Tule River Tribe of California who have been out front advocating for these actions for years, tribes around the state like (the) Karuk, and, of course, Maidu Summit Consortium leaders,\" Bonham said in a news release. \"The future looks much better because of these leaders.\" 2023 The Sacramento Bee.

        "content": "Sometimes when I’m looking out across the northern meadow of Brooklyn’s Prospect Park, or even the concrete parking lot outside my office window, I wonder if someone like Shakespeare or Emily Dickinson could have taken in the same view and seen I don’t mean making out blurry details or more objects in the scene. But through the lens of their minds, could they encounter the exact same world as me and yet have a richer experience? One way to answer that question, at least as a thought experiment, could be to compare the electrical activity inside our brains while gazing out upon the same scene, and running some statistical analysis designed to actually tell us whose brain activity indicates more richness. But that’s just a loopy thought experiment, right? Not exactly. One of the newest frontiers in the science of the mind is the consciousness’s “complexity,” or how diverse and integrated electrical activity is across the brain. Philosophers and neuroscientists alike that more complex brain activity signifies “richer” experiences. The idea of measuring complexity stems from — a mathematical approach to understanding how information is stored, communicated, and processed —which doesn’t provide wonderfully intuitive examples of what more richness actually means. Unless you’re a computer person. “If you tried to upload the content onto a hard drive, it’s how much memory you’d need to be able to store the experience you’re having,” , a professor of machine learning and data science at the University of Sussex, told me. Another approach to understanding richness is to look at how it changes in different mental states. Recent studies have found that are lowest in patients under general anesthesia, higher in ordinary wakefulness, and higher still in psychedelic trips, which can notoriously turn even the most mundane experiences — say, my view of the parking lot outside my office window — into . Increasing richness isn’t just like cranking up the color saturation of a picture or getting a bigger hard drive. It seems to imply an increase in the depth of how we experience the world. Complexity is what you see in the equations, richness is what that feels like in the mind. Although measuring brain complexity is still in relative infancy, the nascent ability to gauge something like richness is a pretty incredible development — not only for but for how we think about well-being more broadly. With innovations like these, we can go beyond the , which doesn’t have an accepted neurological measure that can translate across social and cultural differences, and ask more targeted questions, like whether our experiences are richer. As these approaches mature, scientists might develop a deeper understanding of all the different, tractable ways that consciousness can change for the better. From staining neurons black to measuring the brain’s complexity In the 1800s, scientists studying the mind didn’t yet know what a neuron looked like, let alone how they worked. That breakthrough came in , when physician Camillo Golgi discovered that by immersing brain tissue in a potassium dichromate solution and then dunking it in a bath of silver nitrate, the neuron would turn black, making it visible under a microscope. The Spanish neuroscientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, when observing newly stained neural tissue in 1887, discovered that contrary to the reigning reticular theory (which held that the nervous system was a continuous network of cells smushed together with no gaps), neurons were indeed separated from each other. Sprouting from the neuron’s edges were spindly little axons and dendrites, but they didn’t seem to create permanent bridges between the neurons, leading him to conclude that communication between neurons likely wasn’t all that important in explaining their main functions. Instead, individual neurons were taken as the nervous system’s fundamental units, or building blocks, an idea that solidified into “the .” Through the 20th century, developments in electrophysiology led to a sharper understanding of the connections between neurons, and the importance of the little electrical impulses that travel across synapses. But the basic perspective of focusing on neurons themselves, rather than the holistic electrical processes that they’re conduits for, remained dominant. This approach has gotten quite good at breaking the brain into distinct parts and explaining how they contribute to specific functions, like vision or controlling your fingers. The downside is that many theories of consciousness struggle with what’s called the — the question of how all the separate parts fit back together to generate a unified conscious experience. Recent improvements to electroencephalography (EEG, those skull caps with a bunch of electrodes that measure the brain’s electrical activity) made it possible to look deeper inside the workings of the brain, opening the way for neuroscientist Giulio Tononi and biologist Gerald Edelman’s 1998 paper: . Their publication was the first to propose a direct measure of the complexity of brain activity, an idea that matured into , or IIT. According to IIT, consciousness arises where the underlying neural activity is both “integrated” and “differentiated.” Integration refers, roughly, to how synchronized electrical activity is across the brain. Differentiation is the diversity of that activity. You can think of them in terms of weaving a tapestry. Integration is how many different threads are woven in, while differentiation is the variety of colors used. Together, these two determine the complexity of a given state of consciousness. That, in turn, approximates its richness. In theory, anyway. At the time, the idea ran ahead of technology. “It became apparent over the years that it’s quite hard to measure those two things simultaneously,” Barrett told me, “and it turned out that the differentiation aspect alone, without thinking about integration, did quite well at being able to distinguish between different states of consciousness.” That said, our measures are improving quickly. Barrett co-authored released as a pre-print last week that compared a new measure of complexity — what they call “statistical complexity” — to Lempel-Ziv complexity, which was first in 1976 and is still the field’s leading measure. While Lempel-Ziv captures only the differentiation aspect, their findings suggest that the new measure successfully brings integration back into the mix, affording greater precision. As progress continues, IIT may creep closer to its grand ambition: constructing an equation that can measure and describe the richness of conscious experience in any physical system, whether human, animal, or machine. “That fails at the moment,” said Barrett, “but I’m very interested in seeing if we could come up with a plausible equation. That’s sort of the holy grail for me.” So what do we make of richness? If a plausible equation isn’t the kind of thing that occupies your dreams, a concrete measure for something like richness could bring some sorely needed innovation to our ideas around . The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (the DSM-5) contains diagnoses to help clinicians classify just about every shade of mental disorder they might encounter. When it comes to the positive dimensions of mental health, however, our language is comparatively sparse. “Happiness” is a very nebulous idea, especially when you . We in the West, unlike the Buddhists, have not developed rigorous taxonomies for all the rungs on the mental ladder — from our default modes to the ecstasies, grades of zest, or senses of “ ” that lurk in the (reportedly, anyway). If we can quantify the richness of our minds, maybe it could jumpstart the process of finding other tractable dimensions we can add to our conceptions of well-being. Of course, quantifying something important always (à la : when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure), and being wise about how to make sense of these new ideas will be bumpy. It’s tempting, for example, to simply think that when it comes to richness, more is always better. But researchers, like 50 honoree , believe that the brain evolved to hold levels of complexity below a threshold called “criticality,” rather than just maximize it. In information theory, criticality marks the optimal balance of complexity for processing information, a perch between order and chaos. Or in terms of the mind, between the rigidity and flexibility of mental habits. Too much complex activity pushes the brain over the edge. That might offer a temporarily exciting state of mind (as psychedelic trips can), but in terms of efficiently processing information to be successful creatures in the world, a never-ending acid trip is probably not the ideal state. “A brain at criticality may be a ‘happier’ brain,” Carhart-Harris . If criticality means greater well-being calls for a particular balance of complexity, not just as much as we can muster, that doesn’t mean that we’re all, by default, naturally tuned to that balance. As our measures and technologies improve, maybe we’ll get better at identifying when someone’s ordinary brain activity is below criticality, and a burst of complexity could serve as a boon to well-being. Maybe we’ll develop new ways of growing richer, not just in our bank accounts (though that may help), but in the ways that we experience the world.",

        "description": "B cells are prolific producers of antibodies, but for the first time, scientists have modified them to make other proteins to counteract a serious genetic disease.",
        "content": "Our B cells help prevent us from getting sick. Their job is to make antibodies, immune system proteins that fight off viruses and other foreign invaders. And they make a lot of antibodies—thousands of them every second. What if these antibody factories could be harnessed to make other things the body needs? That’s the idea behind a trial launched by Seattle-based biotech company Immusoft. The company announced today that its scientists have genetically programmed a patient’s B cells and put them back in his body in an effort to treat disease. It’s the first time engineered B cells have been tested in a person. The patient has a genetic disorder known as mucopolysaccharidosis type I, or MPS I. His body doesn’t produce an essential enzyme that helps to break down long-chain sugars inside cells. Without this enzyme, these sugars build up in the eyes, heart, bones, and elsewhere. The effects are life-threatening. Patients have cloudy eyes, respiratory problems, cognitive issues, and enlarged organs. Those with the most severe form of the disease die in childhood. Others may live to their twenties or thirties. Patients are currently treated with weekly infusions of the enzyme their body lacks. The therapy must be given for the entirety of a patient’s life. Typically, a gene called IDUA provides instructions for making this enzyme, but people with MPS I have a mutation in this gene. Immusoft’s aim is to override this problem by prompting a person’s B cells to make the enzyme instead. B cells appealed to Immusoft because of their ability to pump out lots of proteins. If a person’s B cells could provide a continuous supply of this enzyme, it could eliminate the need for regular infusions. Sean Ainsworth, CEO of Immusoft, says the initial patient is doing well after receiving the experimental therapy in mid-November. “So far, so good,” he says. Researchers at the company collected the patient’s B cells using a machine that removes blood, separates out a particular component, then returns the rest to circulation. There are billions of B cells in the body; Immusoft uses only a portion. “The body is constantly regenerating and producing new B cells,” Ainsworth says. To get the B cells to produce the missing enzyme in addition to antibodies, scientists had to add new genetic instructions to them in the lab. They packaged those instructions into a transposon, a DNA sequence that can naturally integrate into a cell’s genome using a cut-and-paste mechanism. Several commercially available therapies involve genetically engineering a patient’s cells outside the body to treat disease. A newly approved treatment for sickle cell disease uses Crispr to edit a patient’s blood-forming stem cells. And a type of “living drug” known as CAR-T cell therapy supercharges a patient’s T cells against cancer. No current therapies use a person’s B cells. “It seems to me it was the obvious thing to move from T cells to B cells,” says Abla Creasey, vice president of therapeutics development at the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, which has awarded $12,000 in grants to Immusoft. She says B cells represent an exciting new strategy to treat disorders in which the body doesn’t make enough of a certain protein or enzyme. The field is still new, says David Rawlings, an immunologist at Seattle Children’s Hospital who is working on engineered B cell therapies. That’s in part because B cells proved more difficult to manipulate than other types of cells. His lab is using Crispr to modify B cells, and he cofounded a company, Be Biopharma, to further develop them. “The uses are really broad because you can think of them as a drug-secreting platform that lasts for a long time,” Rawlings says. Existing engineered cell therapies have shown miraculous effects, but they come with downsides. In the case of the Crispr treatment, patients first undergo chemotherapy, which can cause hair loss, nausea, and other unpleasant side effects. After treatment, they must then stay in the hospital for weeks while their edited stem cells take up residence in the bone marrow. With CAR-T cell therapy, serious immune or nervous system effects can occur, so patients must be monitored in the hospital. By contrast, Immusoft’s engineered B cells are given as an IV infusion in an outpatient procedure, Ainsworth says. Paul Orchard, the doctor running the trial at the University of Minnesota Medical School, says the original plan was to treat children with the disease. “It’s easier to prevent complications than it is to reverse them after they’ve already happened,” he says. “If you can identify kids and intervene relatively early in life, they’re more likely to get benefits.” However, the US Food and Drug Administration has limited the team to working with adults initially, until the therapy is shown to be safe. He says one concern the FDA has with engineering B cells is the possibility that they could turn cancerous, giving rise to lymphoma or leukemia. The transposon system Immunosoft uses inserts the new genetic material in a random fashion, so Orchard says there’s a theoretical risk that it could do so near a cancer-causing gene. This is also a known risk with current CAR-T cell therapies, which use viruses to deliver new genetic material to cells. Scientists can’t precisely control where in the genome viruses drop off their payload. Immusoft’s initial trial is meant to test safety of its engineered B cell approach, so patients will continue receiving their usual enzyme infusions for now. The next step will be to take patients off the infusions to see whether the modified B cells are doing what they’re supposed to do. Orchard says they’ll measure enzyme levels in the blood and also look for improvement in patients’ symptoms, including movement and heart function. One big question investigators are hoping to answer is how long the engineered B cells stick around in the body. Some B cells last for decades, Orchard says. “We’ll have to see. Obviously, it would be better if it's a definitive therapy and a one-time administration.”",

        "description": "Highly caffeinated drinks have become a cultural staple. But following a death allegedly related to Panera Bread’s Charged Lemonade, has our collective obsession with energy drinks become unsafe?",
        "content": "Whenever he visited his local branch of Panera Bread in Fleming Island, Florida, it was Dennis Brown’s habit to order three drinks in a row. On September 28, and again on October 2, and the 4th, 5th, 7th, and 9th—the day Brown died—his drink of choice was Panera Bread’s Charged Lemonade. A 20-ounce serving of Charged Lemonade contains 260 milligrams of caffeine, while the 30-ounce cup has 390 mg—close to the US Food and Drug Administration’s recommended daily limit. It isn’t known which size Brown, 46, consumed on October 9, but after finishing his dinner, he left the American fast casual restaurant and suffered a fatal cardiac arrest on a nearby sidewalk shortly after. A wrongful-death lawsuit filed against Panera Bread on behalf of Brown’s family states that he usually drank iced tea, root beer, or water and was allegedly unaware that Charged Lemonade contains caffeine, as the lawsuit says it wasn’t advertised as an energy drink. Elizabeth Crawford, the attorney representing Brown’s family, has claimed the drink is “a wolf in sheep’s clothing.” Panera Bread says it’s not to blame. “Panera Bread expresses our deep sympathy to Mr. Brown’s family. Based on our investigation, we believe his unfortunate passing was not caused by one of the company’s products,” Jessica Hesselschwerdt, senior director of public relations at Panera Bread, told WIRED. Hesselschwerdt says the case against the company is “without merit,” that Panera “stands firmly by the safety of our products,” and that Charged Lemonade contains “the same amount of caffeine per ounce as a dark roast coffee.” That may be true. But while health bodies advise that consuming caffeine is OK, as long as we don’t overdo it, in recent years caffeinated drinks have been getting bigger and stronger—so much so that regulators are stepping in. Panera Bread’s drinks aren’t the only ones to have raised concern. In January 2022, the internet found itself in a frenzy over Prime , an energy drink developed by YouTube stars turned boxers Logan Paul and KSI. Sold in neon-colored cans and advertising zero sugar and vegetarian-friendly ingredients, the brand was an immediate hit among the influencer’s combined—and often very young—40 million Instagram followers, who posted their own viral videos of themselves frantically searching for cans of the drink. By July, US Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer had requested an FDA investigation into the brand, claiming parents were unwittingly serving their children a “cauldron of caffeine” when they purchased the drink. (Prime contains 200 mg of caffeine per 12 ounces—roughly equal to two cans of Red Bull plus a cup of coffee.) In response to Schumer’s calls, the company released a public statement claiming that “Prime energy … contains a comparable amount of caffeine to other top-selling energy drinks.” The drink is still for sale in the US and UK, but it was one of six energy drinks recalled in Canada earlier this year, with new legislation outlawing drinks containing more than 180 mg of caffeine in a single serving. In a video after the announcement, Paul said that the drinks are compliant with each country’s specific regulations, claiming, “The crazy part about that is, we don’t even distribute Prime Energy in Canada.” Lithuania, Latvia, Turkey, and Poland have also implemented a general ban on the sale of energy drinks to under-18s, with a UK government ban consultation stalling during the pandemic. These moves are a response to a modern trend—the rise of stronger and stronger drinks—but also part of a pattern that dates back over a century. The US Department of Agriculture voiced worries about the excessive amounts of caffeine in Coca-Cola as early as 1909. The US Pure Food and Drug Act was amended in 1912, adding caffeine to the list of “habit-forming” substances that should be clearly announced on food labels. As a result, Coke cut its caffeine levels in half. Today, Coca-Cola would barely register as an energy drink, containing 34 mg of caffeine per 12-ounce serving. (Diet Coke is slightly more caffeinated, at 46 mg per 12 ounces.) Some same-size caffeinated drinks available today contain 300 to 400 mg . “Energy drinks are safe in the same way that a doughnut is safe—one every now and again is fine, but eating too many will exceed recommended intake for calories, sugar, and fat,” says nutrition therapist and author Ian Marber . Marber explains that caffeine has a similar chemical structure to adenosine, a substance that is part of the process of creating energy, and acts like a neurotransmitter in the brain. “In essence, adenosine promotes sleep, but metabolites in caffeine prevent it from doing its job, promoting alertness in place,” he explains. “This in turn triggers the adrenal glands to produce adrenaline and cortisol, both of which make us feel alert and capable.” The effects can last for around four hours and can be useful in small doses. But exceed the limits and you might experience anxiety, fatigue, and interrupted sleep patterns. “What makes a substance toxic is the dose,” says Alex Ruani, a doctoral researcher at University College London and chief science educator at the Health Sciences Academy . Coffee is packed with caffeine—66 mg for a “tall” Americano or latte at Starbucks—but “most energy drinks have exorbitant amounts of caffeine, ranging from 60 milligrams to 200 milligrams plus,” she says. “The FDA and its European equivalent, the EFSA , both agree that 400 milligrams of caffeine is a safe daily limit. But here’s the caveat: Consuming this much caffeine in one go could be fatal, especially when consumed for the first time .” In fact, the EFSA advises a single intake of no more than 200 mg of caffeine (around 3 mg per kilogram of body weight) and that the 400 mg limit be split into smaller intakes across the day. As well as containing vast amounts of caffeine, the added ingredients in some energy drinks can also be harmful. “Energy drinks often contain other stimulants like B vitamins, L-carnitine, L-theanine, and glucuronolactone,” says Ruani. “When combined, drinkers are faced with a potentially hazardous cocktail that can upset several body systems, including the brain and the heart.” It’s also possible to become addicted to them. “Both sugar and caffeine have addictive properties,” says Ruani. The popularity of energy drinks has been on the rise for decades—and much of their success rests not on their sugary, stimulating formulations but on their marketing. Lucozade (then called Glucozade), perhaps the first drink that would be deemed an energy drink by modern standards, launched in 1927. But it wasn’t until the rise of Red Bull in 1987 that energy drinks began their modern associations—first with extreme sports and then gaming. Energy drinks were no longer just a health tonic, as once advertised, but an essential lifestyle component. Red Bull, which sold more than 11 billion cans in 2022, and Monster Energy are the two leading energy drinks in the United States, with Celsius, Bang Energy, and Rockstar rounding out the most popular choices. Red Bull is also the leading energy drink in the UK, generating £349 million ($445 million) in sales in 2023, well ahead of its nearest competitor, Monster, at £289 million. Worldwide, the energy drinks market is set to be worth $108.4 billion by 2031, up from $45.8 billion (£35.9 billion) in 2020. This acceleration coincides with another marketing pivot—moving into the world of influencers. According to influencer marketing analytics site Tribe Dynamics , in 2021 brands including Bang Energy, GFuel, and Monster “raced ahead on social media by winning over distinct content creator communities.” They did this through three main channels: TikTok influencers, online gamers, and sponsored athletes. “Marketing to the gaming sector is a growing opportunity, with huge events all over the world,” says Vhari Russell, founder of The Food Marketing Experts . “This was a great way to grow throughout lockdown, when more people were gaming.” But social problems have arisen alongside this. “The biggest drinkers of energy drinks are adolescents,” says Ruani. “In the UK and Europe , as many as seven in 10 teens consume them, and two in 10 children.” Ruani points to evidence of multiple hospitalizations and deaths of children and adults that have been attributed to the consumption of energy drinks. “It’s outrageous that energy-drink manufacturers deny targeting kids and youngsters,” she says. “The proof is on the can: many displaying colorful designs and childhood flavors like ‘bubble gum’ and ‘ice pop.’ Couple that with the hype sparked by TikTok influencers, and it’s no wonder that kids and teens are obsessed with them.” Dan Tai ( @dantai ), an online coach and fitness model with 824,000 Instagram followers, drinks about four energy drinks per week and markets them on his page. Chelsie Cahoon ( @thesoberraver ) works as a promo model for an energy drink brand called Celsius, despite limiting herself to just three energy drinks per year. “I never liked drinking them because of how much sugar a lot of them have,” she says. Both believe the onus is on the brands to warn consumers of the dangers, though Cahoon adds that consumers should carry out “additional research” into what they consume. In the US, the FDA has not imposed specific restrictions or requirements on the sale or labeling of energy drinks, but the American Beverage Association’s Guidance for the Responsible Labeling and Marketing of Energy Drinks does lay out some rules, including that energy-drink packaging must declare the total amount of caffeine per drink, that they cannot be marketed at children, and that they cannot be labeled as dietary supplements. Adherence to these rules is voluntary, however, and 5 percent of energy drinks sold in the US don't follow them. And given current rates of energy-drink consumption among teenagers and children both in the US and UK, the efficacy of such rules is questionable. Given all of this, the most recent transition in the energy drink market can be seen as the most alarming: their transmogrification into health drinks, with brands such as Tenzing, Brio Yerba Mate, and PerfectTed flooding supermarket shelves. “The changes we see in the energy drinks industry is a result of wider health and wellness trends,” says Rachel Yon Choi, behavioral analyst at brand consultancy Canvas8 . “While people still want energy-boosting drinks, they want that boost from a source that’s beneficial to their body and well-being. They’re moving away from sugar, synthetic, and ultra-processed ingredients to seek out cleaner, ‘better for you,’ and lower-calorie products.” Huib van Bockel, founder of Tenzing, took inspiration for his brand from “Sherpa tea” (typically organic black tea, with added yak butter and salt, making it rich in electrolytes, fat, and natural caffeine), as well as Tenzing Norgay, who along with Edmund Hillary became one of the first people to summit Everest in 1953. With sherpas known for seemingly superhuman feats in oxygen-depleted “death zones,” the health connotations are clear. “We have the same amount of natural caffeine as a cup of coffee and 60 percent less sugar than a traditional energy drink,” says Van Bockel. “Because of the low sugar levels and our natural blend of caffeine, L-theanine, electrolytes, and vitamin C, you get the uplift but not the crash,” he says. Marber, while not specifically addressing Tenzing, is clear that adding in “healthy” ingredients doesn’t magically turn an energy drink into a health tonic. “There’s nothing wrong with some caffeine and sugar, but having lower amounts than other offerings doesn’t make it ‘healthy’ any more than adding nutrients does,” he says. Again, it’s down to consumer habits. “I don’t think there are unhealthy foods, more unhealthy habits. So an average quality drink here and there is fine, more often isn’t,” Marber says. Ultimately, Russell believes that empowering consumers to make better choices could be the solution to curbing potentially dangerous caffeine consumption. “It’s informing them as to why a cup of coffee or tea might be better than an energy drink,” she says. Panera Bread has tried this. On October 30, the brand added prominent warnings to its Charged Lemonade in stores and online, reading: “Use in moderation. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR children, people sensitive to caffeine, pregnant or nursing women.” At the time of writing, three “Charged” drinks remain available on Panera’s website, including Blood Orange Charged Splash (150–219 mg of caffeine) and Strawberry Lemon Mint Charged Lemonade (158–237 mg). And the buzz around these and other highly colored, high-power drinks is showing no signs of slowing down.",

        "description": "Hominid cannibalism, “dark stars,” the secrets of Earth’s core and more tantalizing findings will require more evidence before scientists can confirm them as fact.",
        "content": "By From ancient cannibalism to stars made of dark matter, 2023 delivered several scientific claims that could shake up their fields — if they shape up to be true. Early life on Earth may have gotten a boost from giant volcanic eruptions. A new look at debris from 10 eruptions millions of years ago suggests they ( ). The eruptions could have triggered fierce lightning that ripped apart molecular nitrogen, freeing nitrogen atoms to bond with other elements and form molecules useful to life — including nitrate. The same process may have happened billions of years ago, some scientists say, producing ingredients for early life. Scientists will need to account for the different chemical makeup of primordial Earth’s atmosphere to bolster that claim. Purported tool marks on a 1.45-million-year-old fossilized leg offer , researchers contend ( ). The marks on the bone, found in Kenya, could have been made by some unidentified hominid using a stone tool to carve muscle away from the shin of another hominid. But a few bone nicks do not cannibal table scraps make, some paleoanthropologists say. A handful of galaxies from the very early universe are , data from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope suggest ( ). The hefty galaxies not only challenge the idea that matter clumped together slowly over the universe’s lifetime, but also hint at some unknown way to fast-track galaxy formation. But the galaxies’ weights and distances must be confirmed with more detailed analyses of their light before astronomers rewrite cosmic history. The thymus may not be inconsequential for ( ). This immune system organ between the lungs is most active in childhood and withers with age, so it is often considered expendable in adulthood. In a study of more than 2,000 adults who had chest surgery, however, researchers reported that removing the thymus gland was associated with higher rates of death and of cancer within the next few years. Why thymus removal might be harmful remains unclear. Honoring the dead may not be unique to big-brained hominids like and Neandertals. , which lived around the same time as early but had an orange-sized brain, in an underground South African cave, a group of researchers claims ( ). Other experts remain unconvinced, though. The supposedly buried bodies, which predate the earliest evidence of . and Neandertal burials by 160,000 years, could have fallen through cave shafts or been washed by water into natural depressions in cave floors, skeptics say. Separate studies both based on earthquake data are shaking up geologists’ concept of Earth’s heart. The solid inner core not only rotates but also appears to relative to the mantle and crust every few decades ( ). The inner core may also have ( ). Other data, however, hint that the inner core reverses every few years or does not rotate at all. And the supposed discovery of the innermost core hinges on a type of seismic wave that bounces around Earth’s interior, becoming weaker and more difficult to detect with every bounce. Thankfully, whatever is going on down there does not seem to endanger life on the surface. The James Webb Space Telescope may have spotted stars made of dark matter — the unidentified stuff that makes up most matter in the cosmos ( ). So-called dark stars are so far hypothetical, but JWST giving off the kind of light expected from such stars. If they exist, dark stars could shed new light on star formation and the nature of dark matter. However, the pinpricks of light in JWST’s field of view could also come from normal stars, so astronomers will need more detailed data to tease out the objects’ true nature.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked preprint trusted source proofread by Tomasz Nowakowski , Phys.org By analyzing the early data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), an international team of astronomers has identified 95 new extremely metal-poor galaxies at a low redshift. The finding is detailed in a paper published December 1 on the pre-print server arXiv . Extremely metal-poor galaxies (XMPGs) are the ones with metallicity below 0.1 of the solar metallicity. Given that these galaxies are chemically unevolved, they can serve as excellent laboratories for investigating the chemical evolution theories of galaxies and studying the physical processes in the early stages of their evolution. Although XMPGs are assumed to be quite common at high redshift, they are difficult to observe due to their low masses. Therefore, astronomers are interested in the observations of local XMPGs at low redshift, as they are perceived as possible analogs of primeval high-redshift young galaxies of this type in terms of mass and metallicity. Now, a group of astronomers led by Hu Zou of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China, has obtained a large sample of XMPGs based on the early data from DESI. \"This work focuses on the analysis of DESI early data, including the Early Data Release (EDR; DESI Collaboration et al. 2023b), the detection of XMPGs and exploration of their mass-metallicity relation,\" the researchers wrote in the paper. All in all, the team first selected 1,623 star-forming galaxies with significant oxygen emission lines detection. From this sample, they identified 223 extremely metal-poor galaxies at redshifts below 1.0. Finally, they confirmed 95 of them as bona fide XMPGs, while the 128 galaxies remain XMPG candidates. Most of the XMPGs reported in the study were found at a low redshift of below 0.3 and turned out to be dwarf galaxies—with stellar masses not exceeding 1 billion solar masses . The most metal-poor galaxy in the sample, designated DESIJ150535.89+314639.4, has an oxygen abundance at a level of only 1/34 of that of the sun, has a stellar mass of about 15 million solar masses, and its star-forming rate was calculated to be 0.22 solar masses per year. The astronomers noted that preliminary imaging examination of the two most metal-poor galaxies discovered from their sample revealed two different morphologies. This suggests different evolution and physical origins; however, further studies are required in order to confirm this hypothesis. Summing up the results, the authors of the paper underlined that the extremely metal-poor galaxies detected by them are possibly low- redshift analogs of galaxies at high redshifts reaching 6.0 or even beyond. Therefore, they could be excellent objects for exploring the universe at its early stages of evolution.

        "content": "December 15, 2023 report This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked preprint trusted source proofread by Tomasz Nowakowski , Phys.org Astronomers from the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) and elsewhere, report the discovery of a new 'warm Jupiter' exoplanet orbiting a rapidly rotating F-type star. The newfound alien world, designated TOI-4641 b could be nearly four times as massive as Jupiter. The finding was detailed in a paper published December 7 on the pre-print server arXiv . In general, warm Jupiters are gas giant planets with orbital periods between 10 and 200 days. This makes them challenging targets for transit detection, and radial velocity follow-up studies, compared to their shorter-orbit counterparts known as hot Jupiters. Now, a group of astronomers led by CfA's Allyson Bieryla has found a new exoplanet of this type. Using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which is conducting an all-sky survey searching for transiting extrasolar worlds, they identified a transit signal in the light curve of TOI-4641—a bright and rapidly rotating F-star (with a projected rotational velocity of approximately 86.3 km/s). The planetary nature of this signal was confirmed by follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations. \"A candidate exoplanet orbiting TOI-4641 with a period of 22.1d was identified in light curves including data through Sector 43 in both SPOC and QLP pipelines,\" the researchers wrote in the paper. The newfound planet has a radius of about 0.73 Jupiter radii and its maximum mass was calculated to be 3.87 Jupiter masses. The observations indicate that TOI-4641 b orbits its host star every 22.09 days at a well-aligned orbit, at a distance of some 0.173 AU from it. TOI-4641 b is therefore among the longest period planets, to be thoroughly characterized, that orbits a hot rapidly rotating star. The parent star TOI-4641 (also known as TIC 436873727), located some 286 light years away, has a radius of about 1.72 solar radii and is approximately 41% more massive than the sun. The star is estimated to be 2.69 billion years old, has a metallicity at a level of -0.09, and its effective temperature was found to be 6,560 K. The authors of the paper underlined that long-period exoplanets like TOI-4641 b could be crucial for testing mechanisms that induce primordial misalignment in planetary systems , given that at such orbital distances, star-planet tidal interactions are assumed to be too weak to modify the orbital obliquity. \"Testing these predictions motivate full characterizations of planets in long-period orbits about early-type stars,\" the scientists concluded. All in all, Bieryla's team proposes a few mechanisms behind such misalignment, including chaotic accretion, magnetic warping, or changes to the spin axes of early-type stars, as well as stellar or planetary companions during the primordial phase of formation.

        "description": "Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy has presented a budget plan that proposes paying residents a $3,400 oil-wealth dividend next year and using savings to cover a $990 million deficit.",
        "content": "close Video Alaska man finds himself on the same path as a large moose in Anchorage A cautious observer captures the moment he encountered a large moose walking through a neighborhood near Anchorage, AK. Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy revealed a budget plan proposing a $3,400 oil-wealth dividend for residents next year. The budget does not include an increase in the per-student K-12 school funding formula, but Dunleavy, a former educator, anticipates education discussions during the upcoming legislative session. Other items in the budget plan include funding for staff to address a food stamp benefits backlog. Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy unveiled a budget plan Thursday that would pay residents an oil-wealth dividend of about $3,400 next year using a formula that lawmakers have all but abandoned and use savings to plug an estimated $990 million deficit. The proposal does not include an increase in the per-student K-12 school funding formula, though Dunleavy, a former educator, said he expected education to be at the fore of discussions when lawmakers convene for their new legislative session next month. He said he wanted lawmakers to consider his proposal from last session that would provide bonuses to teachers as a way to help recruit and retain them. Dunleavy blasted the federal government and groups that have challenged oil, mining and other development projects in Alaska , saying it has left the state with choices such as having to make budget cuts, tax residents and businesses, or reduce the size of the yearly dividend. Alaska has no state sales tax or personal income tax, and for years, without resolution, lawmakers have talked about the need for a fiscal plan that moves away from the boom-bust cycles of budgeting tied to the state's reliance on a volatile commodity: Oil. ALASKA LAWMAKERS PASS SPENDING PACKAGE, ENDING SPECIAL SESSION IN ONE DAY Central to a fiscal plan is how much the yearly dividend should be. For years, until 2015, the dividend was paid according to a formula that many lawmakers have since come to view as unsustainable and unaffordable. In 2016, amid deficits, then-Gov. Bill Walker vetoed about half the amount available for dividends, and the state Supreme Court later decided the dividend program must compete for annual funding like any other state program. Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy speaks to reporters during a news conference at which he unveiled his budget proposals for the coming year on Dec. 14, 2023, in Juneau, Alaska. Dunleavy said the spending proposal includes a deficit of nearly $1 billion that he proposes using savings to cover. (AP Photo/Becky Bohrer) The amount has since been set by what can get enough votes to get a budget passed, with debate over the size of the check often overshadowing other issues. This year's dividend was $1,312 and cost about $880 million, with a potential for a bonus check of up to $500 next year if oil prices exceed forecasts. Dunleavy on Thursday proposed a dividend for next year in line with the formula last used in 2015, at a cost of about $2.3 billion for checks to residents of about $3,400 each, his budget office estimated. The toll of inflation is \"taking a bite out of everybody’s pocketbook. So we’re hoping that we can keep the PFD as high as possible to help Alaskans afford groceries, afford fuel, etc.,\" Dunleavy said at a news conference, referring to the Permanent Fund Dividend. AK GOV. MIKE DUNLEAVY PROPOSES $8.3M FUNDING BOOST TO ADDRESS CASELOAD, STAFFING ISSUES FOR PUBLIC DEFENDER The budget proposal is a starting point. The House and Senate will each have a chance to craft their own versions of the budget, which typically get reconciled through negotiations near the end of a legislative session. The 40-member House has a Republican-led majority. The 20-member Senate is controlled by a bipartisan majority. Senate Finance Committee Co-chair Bert Stedman, a Sitka Republican, in a statement said a focus \"will continue to be a balanced budget without having to dip into our significantly low reserves. It’s our job to allocate resources wisely while addressing the needs of our communities.\" Administration officials on Thursday outlined other items in the budget plan for the fiscal year starting July 1 and as supplemental items for the current year, including funding for additional staff to process a backlog in food stamp benefits. As part of the budget for the current year, the Legislature approved a one-time, $175 million funding boost for schools in response to pleas from local officials seeking a more permanent funding increase. School officials have said that inflation and fixed costs like heating were taking a toll on their budgets and in some cases forcing program cuts or requiring increased class sizes. But Dunleavy vetoed half that extra funding. GOV. DUNLEAVY WANTS TO MAKE AK THE ‘MOST PRO-LIFE STATE’ IN THE US On Thursday, some education leaders said they were disappointed Dunleavy didn't include in his proposal an increase in the school funding formula. Jharrett Bryantt, superintendent of the Anchorage School District, said Alaska districts \"are struggling to attract and retain teachers and classroom support positions due to wages and benefits that cannot compete with those offered in the Lower 48. This directly results in lower student outcomes and larger class sizes.\" He said his district has \"hundreds of open positions that it struggles to fill because of how prospective educators view current conditions of the profession in Alaska.\"",

After countries agreed this week at UN climate talks on a \"transitioning away from fossil fuels\", governments are likely to come under heightened pressure to boost regulation and reject further expansion of oil, gas and coal projects. But that could leave them open to litigation under a secretive arbitration process called investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS), according to UN rights expert David Boyd, who has called it a \"major obstacle\" to environmental action. \"When governments bring in these stronger laws and policies, they're ending up paying millions -- and sometimes billions -- of dollars in compensation,\" Boyd told AFP. Denmark, France and New Zealand have all backed off from stronger regulation on fossil fuel exploration because of ISDS fears, he said. In a report called \"Paying Polluters\", presented to the UN General Assembly earlier this year, Boyd warned that the number of claims -- and the size of the payouts -- were soaring. \"The explosion of ISDS claims in recent years, and the threat of such claims, is led by fossil fuel, mining and other extractive industry corporations,\" Boyd said in his report. ISDS cases targeting actions to protect the environment rose from 12 initiated before 2000, to 37 from 2000 to 2010, and 126 between 2011 and 2021, it said, adding fossil fuel and mining industries have won over $100 billion in awards. That could rise substantially, as \"sunset clauses\" mean even if a state pulls out of a treaty it could still face litigation for some two decades. ISDS mechanisms built into thousands of international treaties have roots in the global reconfiguration after World War Two, as investors based often in former colonial powers sought to protect assets in newly-independent countries. Lukas Schaugg, an international law analyst with the International Institute for Sustainable Development, said the tribunals had historically operated with a \"lack of public scrutiny\". \"People are increasingly talking about the duty of states to regulate with regard to climate,\" said Schaugg, who used to work at the International Chamber of Commerce's arbitration court. Now, \"the clash with the investment treaty regime is increasingly visible\", he said. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development says ISDS poses a particular challenge for the energy transition. In an August report, UNCTAD said of 1,257 publicly-known ISDS claims made by early 2023, 15 percent were initiated by fossil fuel investors. Even renewable companies have filed substantial claims, as countries change investment incentives. The Energy Charter Treaty is the most frequently-invoked international investment agreement in these claims. It \"can amplify existing burdens on countries that are trying to shift from traditional fossil fuel projects to renewable energies\", UNCTAD said. Several wealthy nations have moved to pull out of the ECT, including Germany, France and the Netherlands, while the European Parliament has called for withdrawal of the entire EU. Boyd said even as richer nations reduce their exposure, investors continue to use their territory to target poorer nations. \"It's absolutely gross hypocrisy, it's unjust and it's definitely unequal,\" he said, adding that \"jurisdiction shopping\" also allows foreign companies to open offices in treaty countries to launch claims. According to UNCTAD, 65 percent of cases in 2022 were brought by investors in richer nations -- and 65 percent of cases were against developing countries. Examples of claims include two Australian mining corporations seeking nearly $37 billion from the Republic of Congo -- more than twice its 2022 gross domestic product. \"It's obvious that there's no way on earth the Republic of Congo could pay that kind of compensation, if they were unsuccessful in these claims,\" Boyd told AFP. Often, he said, \"governments just capitulate\". Last year, Pakistan agreed an out-of-court settlement with a foreign firm, which waived penalties that had ballooned to $11 billion in exchange for the reopening of an open-pit copper mine. It was seen as the only solution for the debt-stricken country after a World Bank arbitration tribunal imposed a $5.8 billion penalty in 2019. The Tethyan Copper company told the tribunal it had spent over $240 million on the mine. Boyd said the case illustrates inconsistencies in tribunal awards. Payouts are sometimes based on investors' actual spending on a project, but at other times use a method estimating future earnings. Boyd called for the investment treaty system to be reimagined to align with rights and environmental priorities -- and for ISDS to be \"relegated to the dustbin of history\". \"We've known there's been a climate crisis for 30 years (but) we have companies operating coal fired power plants, saying: 'We had a legitimate expectation we'd be able to continue burning coal forever',\" he said. \"Those arguments are being accepted by these arbitration tribunals.\" © Copyright AFP 2023.

Speaking on the Senate floor on Dec. 14, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the bill’s passage signifies the stance that military service members “don’t deserve to be penalized in any way at all.” “Finally, we are able to right the wrong of Senator Tuberville’s illogical, hurtful, and dangerous holds and the massive impacts the holds had on military families,” Mr. Schumer remarked. “These men and women have worked so hard for our country for so long. [And] because of Senator Tuberville, in a really nasty and whimsical holding back of their promotions, they weren’t getting paid. \"Tonight at long last we are giving these military families, families that have already sacrificed so much, the justice they deserve: their back pay,\" he added. House Passes Massive Defense Bill Despite FISA Objections Senate Passes $886 Billion Defense Policy Bill Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) welcomed the Senate approval and said that military officers \"do not serve any particular political party,\" but rather the nation as a whole. The senator and other conservatives argued that the new policy violates a federal law that bars the use of federal tax dollars to pay for abortions, though the Department of Health and Human Services does so indirectly with substantial funding of the procedure to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. The Senate approved 425 promotions shortly after Mr. Tuberville announced the withdrawal of his blockade. President Joe Biden said the Republican’s hold of military nominations was \"politically motivated.\" “These confirmations are long overdue, and should never have been held up in the first place. Our service members are the backbone of our country and deserve to receive the pay and promotions they have earned,” President Biden said on Dec. 5. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes funding for the multiyear procurement of 10 Virginia class submarines and the development of nuclear-armed cruise missile. It also includes a trilateral nuclear-powered submarine pact with Britain and Australia (AUKUS), initiatives to counter Russia in Europe, foil China in the Pacific, and aid Israel in the Middle East, and investments in Space Force and technologies including artificial intelligence and hypersonics. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed (D-R.I.) said the NDAA will strengthen the U.S. military posture in the Indo-Pacific and secure the nation's interests \"against China’s expanding ambitions.\" \"The bill will reinvigorate our industrial base and provide our military services with the cutting-edge platforms and technologies they need to keep Americans safe,\" Mr. Reed said in a statement.",

Russia has a decades-old tradition of legal abortions, with the issue less divisive as in many more religious Western countries. But over the last few months a flurry of regions have rushed to restrict abortions in private clinics, yielding to demands from the Russian Orthodox church. And health officials have doubled down on policies at state clinics to try to discourage women from terminating. Authorities say they aim to improve Russia's dire demographics, despite evidence that restricting abortion does not increase birth rates and puts women at risk. Activists see it as part of a wider crackdown. \"When a country is at war, it is usually accompanied by this kind of legislation,\" Leda Garina, a Russian feminist activist exiled in Georgia, told AFP. The measures, she said, sent a clear message to Russian women: \"Sit at home and give birth to more soldiers.\" The timing has raised eyebrows -- Russia's abortion rate has already fallen \"almost tenfold\" since the 1990s, according to Russian demographer Viktoria Sakevich. Russian President Vladimir Putin said this week that he was against banning abortion, but that terminations were against state interests. The 71-year-old said he wanted women to \"safeguard the life of the child\" in order to \"resolve the demographic problem\". Russia's abortion debate comes as Putin seeks re-election in March and as he projects an ever more conservative vision of what a Russian family should look like. For years the president has offered financial incentives for Russians to have more children, with the population shrinking fast since the 1990s. But since the Ukraine war, this has acquired new meaning. \"They see this as a question of national survival,\" said political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya. And Putin sees any resistance to social positions adopted by the Kremlin as a Western ploy, she added. \"Abortions are now part of it. They think that convincing a woman to have an abortion is way of worsening Russia's demographic problem -- that it is the West's plan,\" Stanovaya said. Last month, Orthodox church leader Patriarch Kirill urged authorities to curb abortions, claiming the population could be increased with \"the wave of a magic wand\". Since then more than a dozen regions moved to stop or limit abortions in private clinics. Non-state clinics perform mostly pill-based procedures and ask fewer question, according to Sakevich, making them popular for urban women. Government clinics for years have held \"consultations\" seeking to dissuade women from the procedure. But new health ministry recommendations for doctors encourage a more heavy-handed strategy. \"There is a position of trying to stop them, putting pressure on them, scaring them,\" Sakevich said. Some regions, she said, even offer bonuses to doctors if they deter women. If private clinics were banned from performing abortions, Sakevich predicted there could be a \"grey zone\" of clinics taking on paid abortions, hitting poor women the hardest. Sakevich feared it could lead to a black market of abortion pills and even backstreet abortions. Russia's pro-life movement was once marginal but the war has created a \"political environment\" to press more radical initiatives, Stanovaya said. It has also divided the Putin camp. Some male politicians rushed to back restrictions, while Valentina Matvienko -- Russia's highest ranking woman politician -- warned a ban could have \"tragic consequences\". Political analyst Ekaterina Schulmann said the debate is intended to give Russians something to talk about in a pre-election period where \"you can't talk about the war or the state of the economy.\" She said authorities were tackling the demographic problem from the wrong angle. \"They should be fighting early male deaths -- the main cause of a shrinking population -- instead of trying to get women to have more children,\" she said. But talking about men living longer is taboo at a time when Moscow has sent hundreds of thousands of young and middle-aged men to the battlefields in Ukraine. Observers fear the latest restrictions could just be the beginning. \"We can expect more bans, more restrictions,\" said Sergei Zakharov, a senior Russian demographer at the University of Strasbourg in France. Abortions could be removed from the state insurance system, as the church wants, he warned. Zakharov said trying to increase birth rates \"by all means, including restricting abortions, is something Franco's Spain or Mussolini's Italy\" did, adding: \"This has never worked anywhere.\" Experts say male mortality is the elephant in the room with Russia's dire demographics AFP Russian Patriotic Youth movement cadets visit Red Square in Moscow.

The high court judge ruled in favour of the Duke of Sussex in 15 of the 33 sample articles that he submitted as evidence in his lawsuit against MGN, which publishes The Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People. Justice Timothy Fancourt said he had concluded that the newspapers carried out \"extensive\" phone hacking of celebrities between 2006 and 2011, even when a public inquiry into the conduct of the British press was ongoing. \"I consider that his phone was only hacked to a modest extent, and that this was probably carefully controlled by certain people at each newspaper,\" Fancourt said. Prince Harry said in a statement read outside court by his lawyer that the ruling was \"vindicating and affirming\". In a statement a spokesperson for MGN said: \"Where historical wrongdoing took place, we apologise unreservedly, have taken full responsibility and paid appropriate compensation.\" Harry, the younger son of King Charles III, became the first British royal in over a century to take to the witness stand when he gave evidence in the trial. The last time a royal had given evidence in court was in the 1890s, when the future king Edward VII took the stand in a slander trial. Harry, 39, accused the publisher of \"industrial scale\" phone hacking during emotional testimony in which he relived upsetting episodes of his life. He argued he had been the victim of relentless and distressing media intrusion virtually his entire life. The prince and several other claimants alleged the titles engaged in \"illegal information gathering\", including intercepting phone voice mails, to write dozens of stories about him. The Duke of Sussex, as he is also known, has launched legal action against several tabloid media groups, alongside barrages of attacks aimed at his family and the monarchy. \"I've been told that slaying dragons will get you burned,\" he said in his statement. \"But in light of today's victory and the importance of doing what is needed for a free and honest press it's a worthwhile price to pay. The mission continues.\" MGN had admitted to \"some evidence\" of unlawful information gathering, including for a story about Harry. But it had denied voicemail interception and also argued that some claims were brought too late by Harry and the other claimants. Harry has long had a turbulent relationship with the press and holds the media responsible for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, in a 1997 Paris car crash while being pursued by paparazzi. Allegations that tabloid journalists hacked into celebrities' phones first emerged two decades ago and prompted the Leveson inquiry into press conduct. It found that British newspapers had \"wreaked havoc with the lives of innocent people\" and led to the closure of Britain's top-selling newspaper, the Rupert Murdoch-owned News of the World, in 2011. Harry quit the royal family for a life in California with his American wife Meghan and now has a difficult relationship with his father and his brother, Prince William. © Copyright AFP 2023.

        "content": "Senate Republicans in Alabama introduced new legislation on Dec. 12 aimed at promoting election security by ensuring non-American citizens are not able to vote in federal elections. Under the measure, states would be given the power to ensure that individuals provide proof of American citizenship when registering to vote via mail-in application. Specifically, the bill would amend the National Voting Rights Act (NVRA) to put in place proof of citizenship requirement for both the federal mail voter registration form and any state mail voter registration forms. The bill relates to Section 6 of the NVRA, which requires that each state accept and use the federal mail voter registration application forms developed by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission but allows states to develop their own voter registration forms provided they meet all of the same criteria the NVRA requires for the federal mail voter registration form. However, the Republican lawmakers said the Election Assistance Commission and the courts have begun interpreting the prohibition on \"any requirement for notarization or other formal authentication\" as \"precluding efforts by some States to include a requirement of documentary proof of American citizenship with the federal form.\" US Supreme Court Won't Intervene in Key Voting Rights Act Challenge Judge Nullifies Election Over Illegal Votes The co-sponsors of the legislation include all Republican members of the Senate Rules Committee, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Rules Committee Ranking Member Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), and Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) In a statement announcing the newly introduced legislation, Ms. Britt, a member of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, said voting in U.S. elections is a \"sacred right that must solely be limited to American citizens,\" and called her measure \"commonsense.\" \"To allow States to uphold this principle should be simple commonsense, \" she said. \"We are seeing certain cities across our nation begin to openly allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. This effectively disenfranchises hardworking American citizens, insults those American citizens who came to our country legally and took the time and effort to go through the citizenship process, and undermines faith in our entire electoral system – which is a cornerstone of our nation that we cannot allow to crumble.\" \"States have the legal right to prevent noncitizens – including illegal migrants and official representatives of foreign adversaries – from voting in State and Federal elections,\" she concluded. Meanwhile, Mr. Palmer said the American people \"deserve an election system with impeccable integrity\" and that both he and Ms. Britt's legislation will provide a solution to protect the vote of American citizens. \"Her companion legislation will help stop the steady march toward allowing noncitizens to vote in elections around the country. Allowing noncitizens the ability to vote creates endless opportunities for fraud, which will counteract restoring faith in the American election process. This is unacceptable. I look forward to seeing our bills pass in both chambers of Congress,\" the lawmaker said. Mr. Palmer's bill passed the House Committee on Administration in November.",

        "content": "The Australian government has warned that violent acts by Israeli settlers are “terrorising Palestinian communities” in the occupied West Bank, joining with western allies to denounce an “environment of near complete impunity”. Two days after voting in favour of a UN general assembly resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, the Australian government has strengthened its objections to violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. Australia outlined the stance in a joint statement with 13 other countries plus the European Union issued on Friday. The group, which also includes France, Spain, Ireland, Canada and the UK, called on Israel to “take immediate and concrete steps to tackle record high settler violence in the occupied West Bank”. How American citizens lead rise of ‘settler violence’ on Palestinian lands Read more “Since the start of October, settlers have committed more than 343 violent attacks, killing 8 Palestinian civilians, injuring more than 83, and forcing 1026 Palestinians from their homes,” the joint statement said. “We strongly condemn the violent acts committed by extremist settlers, which are terrorising Palestinian communities.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The US took a rare punitive step against Israel last week by announcing visa bans for individuals implicated in violence in the West Bank, a policy replicated by the UK government on Thursday . To date, the Australian government has been silent on whether it would implement a similar policy but it has conveyed its concerns directly to the Israeli government. The foreign minister, Penny Wong , tweeted on Friday evening: “Australia has joined with more than a dozen partners to express our grave concern about the record number of attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank.” The Guardian view on the West Bank: the suffering of Palestinians extends beyond Gaza | Editorial Read more The joint statement said the rise in extremist settler violence against Palestinians was “unacceptable”. “Israel, as the occupying power, must protect the Palestinian civilian population in the West Bank. Those responsible for the violence must be brought to justice,” the statement said. “Israel’s failure to protect Palestinians and prosecute extremist settlers has led to an environment of near complete impunity in which settler violence has reached unprecedented levels. This undermines security in the West Bank and the region and threatens prospects for a lasting peace.” The statement acknowledged the Israeli government had promised to take actions against violent perpetrators, but called for “proactive” steps to protect communities. “Words are important, but must now be translated into action,” it said. A spokesperson for the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said: “The Palestinian civilian population in the West Bank must be protected, and perpetrators of any violence held to account for their actions.” The Israeli ambassador to Australia, Amir Maimon, confirmed last week that the Australian government had used “official channels” to raise the issue of settler attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank.

However, the Australian government is aligned with most countries in agreeing that settlements are illegal under international law. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws show Dfat recommended earlier this year that Australia “refer publicly to Israeli settlement activity as illegal under international law”. Dfat officials pointed to UN security council resolution 2334, which reaffirmed “that the establishment by Israel of settlements in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law”. That prompted Wong to announce in August : “The Australian government is strengthening its opposition to settlements by affirming they are illegal under international law and a significant obstacle to peace.” The joint statement issued by Australia and other countries on Friday reiterated “our position that Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are illegal under international law and remind Israel of its obligations under international law”. The statement specifically mentioned Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which includes that an occupying power “shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies”. The signatories also included Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.",

        "content": "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) knew that America’s meat industry had a drug problem. For decades, evidence had amassed that the widespread use of antibiotics to make livestock grow faster — and survive the crowded, unsanitary conditions of factory farms — was causing bacteria to mutate and develop resistance to antibiotics used in human medicine. Over time, once easily treatable human infections, such as urinary tract infections and tuberculosis, became to treat. A foundational component of modern medicine was starting to crumble. But it wasn’t until the mid-2010s that the FDA finally took the basic steps of requiring farmers to get veterinary prescriptions for antibiotics and banning the use of antibiotics to make animals grow faster — steps that some European regulators had taken a decade or more prior. Thanks to those two actions alone, sales of medically important antibiotics for livestock plummeted 42 percent from 2015 to 2017. But in a concerning course reversal, antibiotic sales for use in livestock have ticked back up, increasing 12 percent from 2017 to 2022, per a new . Sales increased 4 percent in 2022 alone. In 2022, the chicken industry’s antibiotics purchasing slightly declined, but in every other major sector — cattle, pork, and turkey — antibiotic sales rose. “Antibiotic sales to meat producers continue to increase despite efforts that the FDA has made,” Louis Sokolow, a policy associate with Frontier Group, a public health and sustainability research organization, told Vox. “The status quo of these small increases year over year is not enough to protect people from antibiotic-resistant bacteria.” According to an published in September by the Natural Resources Defense Council and One Health Trust, medically important antibiotics are increasingly going to livestock instead of humans. In 2017, the meat industry purchased 62 percent of the US supply. By 2020, it rose to 69 percent. It’s a sobering turn of events with life-and-death implications. In 2019, antibiotic-resistant bacteria directly killed over globally, including , and more than 5 million others across the world died from diseases where antibiotic resistance played a role — far more than the global toll of HIV/AIDS or malaria, leading the World Health Organization to antibiotic resistance “one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today.” Public health advocates want to see the FDA take the threat much more seriously, and often point to Europe as a . From 2011 to 2022, antibiotic sales for use in livestock fell across the European Union, and use per animal is now that of the US. Last year, the EU implemented perhaps its most significant reform yet: banning the routine use of antibiotics to prevent disease, reserving their use for only when animals are actually sick. It’s unlikely the FDA will follow in Europe’s footsteps any time soon. Asked about an EU-style ban on preventive use of antibiotics, an FDA spokesperson responded, “The laws in the US and our livestock population are not the same as that of the EU or other countries. The FDA’s initiatives to promote judicious use and reduce AMR [antimicrobial resistance] were devised specifically for the US and the conditions we face with the aim of maximizing effectiveness and cooperation of drug sponsors, veterinarians, and animal producers.” The FDA and the US food industry have proven that they can make progress on the issue — but to keep antibiotics working, they need to do a lot more. That will require them to tackle beef and pork, two of the more stubborn and complex sectors of America’s meat system that just can’t seem to quit antibiotics, since doing so could demand substantive changes to how animals are farmed for food. The American antibiotic-free revolution that wasn’t It wasn’t just the FDA’s new rules that caused antibiotic sales for livestock to plunge in a two-year period — Big Chicken played a part too. In the early 2000s, the nation’s fourth-largest chicken producer began efforts to wean its birds off antibiotics, which it achieved in 2016 by changing chickens’ diets and replacing antibiotics with vaccines and probiotics. At first, chicken raised without antibiotics cost 50 percent more, but the company says it has since been able to all but close the cost differential. In the mid-2010s, while Perdue was making progress, activists leveraged the momentum and McDonald’s to source chicken raised without medically important antibiotics which contributed to a domino effect in which producers and restaurants made further pledges to reduce antibiotics in poultry. By 2020, a little of America’s 9 billion chickens farmed for meat were raised without antibiotics, according to an . The sea change in chicken production demonstrated it was possible to quickly scale down antibiotics in farming, but it didn’t do much to reduce overall use, as the chicken industry only used 6 percent of antibiotics in agriculture in 2016. And the momentum didn’t spread to other parts of the meat business, like beef and pork, which together account for over of medically important antibiotics fed to farmed animals. Some of the lack of progress in beef and pork comes down to the simple fact that pigs and cattle are raised differently than chickens. Chickens are slaughtered at just six or seven weeks old, so the chance they’ll get sick is lower than pigs, who are slaughtered at six months old, or cattle, slaughtered at around three years of age. The chicken industry is also vertically integrated, meaning a company like Tyson or Perdue controls virtually every link in the supply chain, so making big changes like cutting out antibiotics is easier than in the more decentralized supply chain of beef. For example, the typical steer will change hands several times before slaughter, going from a breeder to pasture grazing to a feedlot, all of which make it harder to coordinate an antibiotic-free regimen. In the last few months of their life cattle are also fed a high-grain diet that they aren’t adapted to digest, which increases the chance they’ll develop a , a condition that’s prevented with antibiotics. The pork sector, like poultry, is also vertically integrated, but the industry has largely opposed , , and reforms. Antibiotics in pig production shot up from 2017 to 2022. There’s also no pork or beef giant that’s taken the antibiotic-free leap like Perdue did for chicken. That could change in the years ahead: McDonald’s, the world’s largest beef purchaser, at the end of 2022 that it plans to reduce antibiotic use in its beef supply chain. However, the announcement didn’t come with a timeline, which . Although voluntary change can move the needle, without regulation, industry has little incentive to make the dramatic reductions needed to safeguard antibiotics. While the FDA has prohibited meat producers from using antibiotics to speed up growth— their in agriculture — some of the that , like tylosin, are still allowed for disease prevention. Matthew Wellington, formerly of the Public Interest Research Group, or PIRG, told Vox this is a that disincentivizes producers from reducing antibiotics: “Our concern has always been that they’re just putting a different name on the same kind of use, which is a problem.” (This story was originally published in January 2023; Wellington has since left PIRG). In response to this concern, an FDA spokesperson said, “Veterinarians are on the front lines and as prescribers, they’re in the best position to ensure that both medically important and non-medically important antimicrobials are being used appropriately.” Aside from outright banning the routine use of medically important antibiotics to prevent disease, PIRG would like to see the FDA take three actions: set a target of reducing antibiotic use by 50 percent by the end of 2025 (based on 2010 levels); publish data on antibiotic use, not just sales; and limit the duration of antibiotic courses for farmed animals. An FDA spokesperson said specific reduction targets weren’t possible because the agency doesn’t know how many antibiotics farmers are using: “We cannot effectively monitor antimicrobial use without first putting a system in place for determining [a] baseline and assessing trends over time.” The agency right now only collects sales data, and it’s been exploring a to collect and report real-world use data. Some states haven’t waited on federal regulators: have both restricted the use of antibiotics on farms. How the Europeans — and some Americans — are quitting antibiotics on the farm Just because it’s difficult to reduce antibiotics in beef and pork production doesn’t mean it’s impossible, as the story of Iowa pig farmers Tim and Deleana Roseland demonstrates. In 2005, they switched from raising pigs in the conventional manner — tightly cramped and fed a steady diet of antibiotics — to raising pigs for Niman Ranch, a higher-welfare meat company now owned by Perdue. That required the Roselands to ditch the routine use of antibiotics. “I was nervous about it at first but as it turned out, it was no big deal whatsoever,” Tim Roseland said. But he added that it wouldn’t have been possible with his old setup: “There’s too much overcrowding, small pens, too many pigs crammed into a little area.” Their newer system gives each pig more space in larger pens, and bedding that they root through and chew on, instead of, when they’re packed into factory farms, chewing on each other. They also give the pigs more vaccines and feed them probiotics. And there’s a lot to learn from Denmark, Europe’s pork producer. From 1992 to 2008, antibiotic use per pig fell by over 50 percent, and while pig mortality went up in the short term, by 2008 it had dropped back to near-1992 levels. The small country’s transformation wasn’t a matter of rocket science, but a suite of smart : more frequent barn cleaning, better ventilation, later piglet weaning, more space per pig, , and experimenting with feed and additives. All this comes with difficult tradeoffs: antibiotic-free pork costs more and requires more land, which increases its carbon footprint. But we can’t expect to have cheap meat forever without a cost to public health, an uncomfortable truth that’s led many environmental and public health groups to champion a message of meat. “I think the fact that Denmark, despite very low antibiotic use since 1995, is still one of the biggest pork exporters in the world, already speaks for itself,” said Francesca Chiara, a director at the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. Given the of global antibiotic sales for agriculture, Denmark’s example may not be speaking loudly enough. But it’s time we listen — nothing less than the future of human medicine is at stake.",

        "content": "Sometimes when I’m looking out across the northern meadow of Brooklyn’s Prospect Park, or even the concrete parking lot outside my office window, I wonder if someone like Shakespeare or Emily Dickinson could have taken in the same view and seen I don’t mean making out blurry details or more objects in the scene. But through the lens of their minds, could they encounter the exact same world as me and yet have a richer experience? One way to answer that question, at least as a thought experiment, could be to compare the electrical activity inside our brains while gazing out upon the same scene, and running some statistical analysis designed to actually tell us whose brain activity indicates more richness. But that’s just a loopy thought experiment, right? Not exactly. One of the newest frontiers in the science of the mind is the consciousness’s “complexity,” or how diverse and integrated electrical activity is across the brain. Philosophers and neuroscientists alike that more complex brain activity signifies “richer” experiences. The idea of measuring complexity stems from — a mathematical approach to understanding how information is stored, communicated, and processed —which doesn’t provide wonderfully intuitive examples of what more richness actually means. Unless you’re a computer person. “If you tried to upload the content onto a hard drive, it’s how much memory you’d need to be able to store the experience you’re having,” , a professor of machine learning and data science at the University of Sussex, told me. Another approach to understanding richness is to look at how it changes in different mental states. Recent studies have found that are lowest in patients under general anesthesia, higher in ordinary wakefulness, and higher still in psychedelic trips, which can notoriously turn even the most mundane experiences — say, my view of the parking lot outside my office window — into . Increasing richness isn’t just like cranking up the color saturation of a picture or getting a bigger hard drive. It seems to imply an increase in the depth of how we experience the world. Complexity is what you see in the equations, richness is what that feels like in the mind. Although measuring brain complexity is still in relative infancy, the nascent ability to gauge something like richness is a pretty incredible development — not only for but for how we think about well-being more broadly. With innovations like these, we can go beyond the , which doesn’t have an accepted neurological measure that can translate across social and cultural differences, and ask more targeted questions, like whether our experiences are richer. As these approaches mature, scientists might develop a deeper understanding of all the different, tractable ways that consciousness can change for the better. From staining neurons black to measuring the brain’s complexity In the 1800s, scientists studying the mind didn’t yet know what a neuron looked like, let alone how they worked. That breakthrough came in , when physician Camillo Golgi discovered that by immersing brain tissue in a potassium dichromate solution and then dunking it in a bath of silver nitrate, the neuron would turn black, making it visible under a microscope. The Spanish neuroscientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, when observing newly stained neural tissue in 1887, discovered that contrary to the reigning reticular theory (which held that the nervous system was a continuous network of cells smushed together with no gaps), neurons were indeed separated from each other. Sprouting from the neuron’s edges were spindly little axons and dendrites, but they didn’t seem to create permanent bridges between the neurons, leading him to conclude that communication between neurons likely wasn’t all that important in explaining their main functions. Instead, individual neurons were taken as the nervous system’s fundamental units, or building blocks, an idea that solidified into “the .” Through the 20th century, developments in electrophysiology led to a sharper understanding of the connections between neurons, and the importance of the little electrical impulses that travel across synapses. But the basic perspective of focusing on neurons themselves, rather than the holistic electrical processes that they’re conduits for, remained dominant. This approach has gotten quite good at breaking the brain into distinct parts and explaining how they contribute to specific functions, like vision or controlling your fingers. The downside is that many theories of consciousness struggle with what’s called the — the question of how all the separate parts fit back together to generate a unified conscious experience. Recent improvements to electroencephalography (EEG, those skull caps with a bunch of electrodes that measure the brain’s electrical activity) made it possible to look deeper inside the workings of the brain, opening the way for neuroscientist Giulio Tononi and biologist Gerald Edelman’s 1998 paper: . Their publication was the first to propose a direct measure of the complexity of brain activity, an idea that matured into , or IIT. According to IIT, consciousness arises where the underlying neural activity is both “integrated” and “differentiated.” Integration refers, roughly, to how synchronized electrical activity is across the brain. Differentiation is the diversity of that activity. You can think of them in terms of weaving a tapestry. Integration is how many different threads are woven in, while differentiation is the variety of colors used. Together, these two determine the complexity of a given state of consciousness. That, in turn, approximates its richness. In theory, anyway. At the time, the idea ran ahead of technology. “It became apparent over the years that it’s quite hard to measure those two things simultaneously,” Barrett told me, “and it turned out that the differentiation aspect alone, without thinking about integration, did quite well at being able to distinguish between different states of consciousness.” That said, our measures are improving quickly. Barrett co-authored released as a pre-print last week that compared a new measure of complexity — what they call “statistical complexity” — to Lempel-Ziv complexity, which was first in 1976 and is still the field’s leading measure. While Lempel-Ziv captures only the differentiation aspect, their findings suggest that the new measure successfully brings integration back into the mix, affording greater precision. As progress continues, IIT may creep closer to its grand ambition: constructing an equation that can measure and describe the richness of conscious experience in any physical system, whether human, animal, or machine. “That fails at the moment,” said Barrett, “but I’m very interested in seeing if we could come up with a plausible equation. That’s sort of the holy grail for me.” So what do we make of richness? If a plausible equation isn’t the kind of thing that occupies your dreams, a concrete measure for something like richness could bring some sorely needed innovation to our ideas around . The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (the DSM-5) contains diagnoses to help clinicians classify just about every shade of mental disorder they might encounter. When it comes to the positive dimensions of mental health, however, our language is comparatively sparse. “Happiness” is a very nebulous idea, especially when you . We in the West, unlike the Buddhists, have not developed rigorous taxonomies for all the rungs on the mental ladder — from our default modes to the ecstasies, grades of zest, or senses of “ ” that lurk in the (reportedly, anyway). If we can quantify the richness of our minds, maybe it could jumpstart the process of finding other tractable dimensions we can add to our conceptions of well-being. Of course, quantifying something important always (à la : when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure), and being wise about how to make sense of these new ideas will be bumpy. It’s tempting, for example, to simply think that when it comes to richness, more is always better. But researchers, like 50 honoree , believe that the brain evolved to hold levels of complexity below a threshold called “criticality,” rather than just maximize it. In information theory, criticality marks the optimal balance of complexity for processing information, a perch between order and chaos. Or in terms of the mind, between the rigidity and flexibility of mental habits. Too much complex activity pushes the brain over the edge. That might offer a temporarily exciting state of mind (as psychedelic trips can), but in terms of efficiently processing information to be successful creatures in the world, a never-ending acid trip is probably not the ideal state. “A brain at criticality may be a ‘happier’ brain,” Carhart-Harris . If criticality means greater well-being calls for a particular balance of complexity, not just as much as we can muster, that doesn’t mean that we’re all, by default, naturally tuned to that balance. As our measures and technologies improve, maybe we’ll get better at identifying when someone’s ordinary brain activity is below criticality, and a burst of complexity could serve as a boon to well-being. Maybe we’ll develop new ways of growing richer, not just in our bank accounts (though that may help), but in the ways that we experience the world.",

Chronic Hand Pain: Often Caused by Overuse, a Therapist's Top 6 Exercises for Relief Rheumatoid Arthritis Relief: This Ancient Therapy's Benefits for Pain and Swelling Raynaud’s phenomenon (also known as Raynaud’s disease or syndrome) is characterized by abnormal vasoconstriction of the small blood vessels of the fingers and toes. It most often affects the fingers and, in rare cases, the ears and nose. Primary: This is the most common form and isn’t a result of another medical condition. When mild, many people don’t seek treatment. Secondary: This is associated with another health condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, scleroderma, or Sjogren’s syndrome. Medications can also play a role. Certain blood pressure, migraine, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medications can exacerbate Raynaud’s syndrome. Smoking is also a risk factor because it narrows the blood vessels. Although exposure to cold temperatures remains the most common cause of flare-ups, repetitive actions or vibrations (such as using jackhammers, typing, or playing the piano) can also trigger bouts of Raynaud’s. Bouts of Raynaud’s syndrome are generally temporary, but some people can have episodes frequent enough or long enough to develop skin ulcers and even gangrene in affected areas.

        "content": "M y life has been ruled by epilepsy since I was a teenager. At 14, I suddenly started experiencing severe seizures as a result of a stroke I’d suffered at birth. At some points, I’d have up to 20 a week – many so violent that I’d break my own nose by punching myself in the face. I rely heavily on the support of my family – I’m now 24, but I’ve never been able to move out from our home in Warwickshire, or stay overnight without them, as there’s always a risk that I might suffer a dangerous seizure without warning. In October 2021, when I was 21, we were on holiday in Cornwall, enjoying walks and steaming-hot pasties. I remember browsing in a jewellery shop in St Ives and buying a painting, but then my mind goes blank. I woke up in a hospital bed 10 days later, bones broken and unable to communicate. My family spent months helping me piece together what had happened. After walking around St Ives, we’d gone on a short hike along the cliffs from Land’s End. At one point, the coastal path narrows and is only about three metres from the rugged cliff edge. My dad saw me suddenly drop off the side of the cliff. I’d had an epileptic fit and fell 40ft, my body ricocheting off the rocks below. My mum saw me from above, lying in a pool of water, a deep shade of crimson lapping around my ears. I had suffered a cardiac arrest, lost three litres of blood and technically died for several minutes Mum somehow managed to climb down the cliff face and found me breathing, though she says my skull had caved in. With the help of a passerby and two paramedics, I was hoisted on to a higher rock to stop me being swept away by the rising tide. After a couple of hours, we were lifted away in a helicopter, and I woke up days later in Treliske hospital in Truro. I had suffered a cardiac arrest, lost three litres of blood and technically died for several minutes. A senior nurse told my family they wouldn’t be able to save me. I still have to stop myself dwelling on that in order to focus on the future. As well as a fractured skull, I had three spinal injuries, both my lungs had collapsed and my pelvis was in multiple pieces. I had a degloving injury on my bottom, where my tissues were ripped from the underlying muscle, which eventually led to me developing sepsis. The only reason I’ve been able to walk again is because my feet were partially protected by my Doc Martens – an orthopaedic doctor told me my left heel had turned to dust. My boots are completely battered, but I’ll keep them for ever. My memories of the first few weeks are hazy: a speech therapist feeding me trifle to see if I could swallow; my sister, Beth, sitting at the side of my bed drinking a smoothie; the searing pain in my head and back. Due to the trauma to my brain, over the 10 months I was in hospital, I would regularly forget why I was there. I’m used to having blanks in my memory because of my epilepsy, but it’s still upsetting when I can’t remember. My mum made a photo diary, but it felt like I was looking at pictures of someone else. This summer I went to visit the team that saved me, but I had no memory of them. I felt awkward in a way, but it was important for me to thank them. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Most people thought I’d have to rely on a wheelchair after my accident, but, although moving is painful, I can walk quite well now. And my memory is better than expected – I managed to watch Pulp Fiction and understand the plot, which was a huge milestone. It’s about celebrating the small victories. In a surreal twist, although my body was badly damaged by the accident, my epilepsy has started to get better. Doctors think the cardiac arrest starved my brain of oxygen long enough to “dampen” the parts causing epilepsy – but not long enough to cause major brain damage – and I’m now only having five or six seizures a month. Before, my epilepsy was so bad that I didn’t really have any quality of life. The day I almost died has turned out to be the day I got my life back, and I’m determined to keep living it.

        "description": "Erin Finley, an award-winning artist in Canada, is the creator of Memory Drawing, a program that helps older adults tap into their memories and express them in vibrant color.",
        "content": "close Video Fox News Flash top headlines for December 14 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. For many aging seniors , memories are precious and fleeting. Now, one Canadian artist is helping some of them capture their favorite scenes in lasting works of art. Erin Finley is an award-winning artist who teaches at OCAD University in Canada. She's the creator of Memory Drawing, a program that helps older adults tap into their memories and express them in vibrant color. Each month, Finley visits a large long-term care facility in Toronto, where she guides residents through the process of creating unique pieces through drawing, coloring and painting. PICKLEBALL HELPS BOOST SENIORS’ MENTAL HEALTH, OFFERING 'ADAPTABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY,' SURVEY FINDS The residents range from intrepid, seasoned artists to beginners who are a bit nervous at first, Finley told Fox News Digital in a video interview. Regardless of their skill level, there's a lot to gain from the sessions, she said. Finley is pictured with one of the artists she works with at the long-term care center. Each week, she visits a long-term care facility in Toronto, where she guides residents through the process of creating their own unique pieces. (Erin Finley) \"I love that they all bring their own life experiences and their own bodies of work that they develop through memory drawing activities,\" she said. Finley first got the idea for Memory Drawing during the COVID-19 pandemic , when she saw \"heartbreaking images\" of people in long-term care facilities who couldn't be with their loved ones. MOST SENIORS IN AMERICA CAN’T AFFORD NURSING HOMES OR ASSISTED LIVING, STUDY FINDS \"I thought, 'What can I do? I'm not in health care , but I want to do something,'\" she said. The artist started contacting local facilities pitching her idea — and the program was born. ‘Self-guided and eager’ For each session, Finley brings some prompts for those who need a little more direction — but she pointed out that some of the seniors are \"very self-guided and eager to tap into their own imaginations.\" Seasonal elements are a popular prompt. In the fall, for example, Finley encourages the seniors to think about the crinkly sound of leaves, the changing colors and the trees moving in the wind. In spring, they might create art based on their favorite flowers. One of the artists at the senior center shows off her artwork at left. At right, Finley is pictured in her art studio. (Erin Finley) As they draw and paint, the group talks about the memories that inspired their work, which often involve favorite people, places and things, Finley said. Sometimes an artist brings a photo of a beloved person or object to recreate. One of the artists is a Corvette enthusiast, for example — so he creates art inspired by the memories of cars he drove and loved as a young man. CAN YOU REDUCE ALZHEIMER’S RISK BY SEEING A HEALTH COACH? COGNITIVE STUDY SUGGESTS IT’S POSSIBLE For residents with cognitive decline , Finley said the art sessions can help spark and sharpen memories, particularly when the seniors focus on texture or touch. For one of the artists, Finley usually starts the drawing and lets him finish. \"I love that they all bring their own life experiences and their own bodies of work that they develop through memory drawing activities,\" Finley said. She's shown here working with a group of artists. (Erin Finley) \"I'll draw half of a maple leaf and he draws the other half,\" she said. \"It adds an interactive component.\" Overall, she said she tries to \"be nimble\" and \"give the residents what they need and what brings them joy.\" ‘So inspired’ Finley said she is constantly inspired by the creativity the seniors exhibit. \"One of the artists takes watercolor paint, which is a dry medium, adds water to it and paints with his thumb,\" she said. \"The end result looks like a beautiful oil painting .\" \"It's uplifting for me. It makes me feel like I'm making a difference and helping in some regard.\" \"The ingenuity is just mind-boggling, and I'm so inspired by it every time I visit.\" As each piece is completed, Finley presents it to the group and celebrates the accomplishment. \"I might lift up the work and say, ‘This is what Lester has done today.’ And then we have a kind of cool gallery moment and we celebrate.\" SENIORS WITH DEMENTIA ARE TREATED TO 'BABY SHOWER' WITH DOLLS TO HELP RELIEVE STRESS: 'SENSE OF PURPOSE' One of the residents is deaf, Finley said, and so the individual communicates only through drawing. \"She'll pass me an image and I'll pass one back — it's beautiful.\" The finished pieces are sometimes displayed in the nursing home or given to loved ones . \"Sometimes they are kind of understood to be legacy pieces, so when a family member passes on, they become the prized belongings of the adult children and the remaining family,\" Finley told Fox News Digital. Finley is shown in her art studio displaying one of her creations. An award-winning artist, she teaches at OCAD University in Canada. (Erin Finley) \"This can be a difficult time for some of the adult children of the seniors I work with, but I get to go in and help them access these memories and create something wonderful for them to enjoy.\" Beyond helping the seniors tap into their own memories, Finley said she herself has also benefited. \"It's uplifting for me,\" she said. \"It makes me feel like I'm making a difference and helping in some regard.\" \"Engaging in artistic activities stimulates certain areas of the brain, helping to keep the mind sharp and active.\" There is also a community-building aspect to the Memory Drawing project, Finley noted, as it brings people out of their isolated spaces and into a collaborative, creative environment for the 90-minute sessions. \"The residents are socializing with each other more than they might have before,\" she said. \"While enacting a painting, we have conversations that are outside the realm of their regular daily routines.\" next Image 1 of 3 An artist at the long-term care facility is pictured with his artwork.

(Erin Finley) Looking ahead, Finley hopes to expand her program to include more nursing homes. \"Maybe the next phase will be enlisting specific artists to be instructors and hold art encounters,\" she said. Benefits of art for seniors Dr. John Whyte, a practicing physician in Washington, D.C. , and chief medical officer of WebMD, shared with Fox News Digital some of the mind-boosting benefits of art for older adults. \"Engaging in artistic activities stimulates certain areas of the brain, helping to keep the mind sharp and active,\" he said. \"This mental stimulation may delay the onset of cognitive decline associated with aging .\" In terms of cognitive health, a doctor noted that artistic activities stimulate neuroplasticity, which is the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections. (Erin Finley) Creating art can also improve seniors’ motor skills, he noted. \"Artistic activities require fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination, which can maintain or improve these abilities in seniors,\" said Whyte. \"Those skills are important for the activities of daily living.\" Art also encourages emotional expression, he noted, which is especially beneficial for seniors who may face social isolation or emotional challenges. 10 TIPS TO LIVE TO BE 100: ‘FAR MORE THAN WISHFUL THINKING,' SAY LONGEVITY EXPERTS \"The act of creating art can be therapeutic and meditative , reducing stress and promoting a sense of calm and relaxation,\" Whyte said. In terms of cognitive health, the doctor noted that artistic activities stimulate neuroplasticity, which is the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections. \"Art projects require attention to detail and concentration.\" Creating art can also trigger memories and stimulate storytelling, he said, \"aiding in the recall of past events and strengthening memory pathways.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER The activity also builds the ability to focus, Whyte said. \"Art projects require attention to detail and concentration, which can enhance these cognitive abilities in seniors.\" Finley is pictured in her art studio. \"The ingenuity is just mind-boggling, and I'm so inspired by it every time I visit,\" she said of her Memory Drawing project.

        "description": "Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), chair of the Senate Finance Committee, vowed to meet monthly with Social Security officials until the problems surrounding overpayment demands are fixed.",
        "content": "The Senate Finance Committee is ramping up oversight of Social Security’s overpayment problem and plans to meet with the agency every month “ .” This story is part of the “Overpayment Outrage” series on TV stations. It can be Do you have an experience with Social Security overpayments you’d like to share? to contact our reporting team. Social Security has been overpaying billions of dollars to people, many on disability — then demanding the money back, even if the government made mistakes, an investigation by KFF Health News and Cox Media Group revealed. The reporting has triggered harsh criticism in Congress and led to an investigation by the agency. The Social Security Administration assured lawmakers in the past that it had been addressed, but “what you all found in your reporting is that the problem hadn’t been fixed,” Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said in an interview. Wyden was referring to by KFF Health News and Cox Media Group television stations reporting how the agency has been issuing billions of dollars in overpayments — benefits it claims people never should have received — and then, sometimes years later, the money back. “Millions of these individuals are walking an economic tightrope, balancing their food bill against the fuel bill, the fuel bill against the rent bill,” Wyden said. “And they have one of these overpayments and it just hits them like a wrecking ball.” Meanwhile, congressional legislation that would raise asset limits for millions of Social Security recipients for the first time in decades has been gaining support. The amounts the agency alleges people owe the government often total tens of thousands of dollars. The recipients include many of the nation’s most vulnerable — people who are disabled and have minimal savings and incomes. Often the overpayments result from errors or lapses on the part of the Social Security Administration. The agency has been sending overpayment notices to a year, according to a government document KFF Health News and CMG obtained through a request under the Freedom of Information Act. The notices typically ask recipients to repay the government within 30 days. They also explain how to appeal or request that the government waive the debt. The Finance Committee oversees Social Security. Wyden spoke with KFF Health News and CMG on Dec. 12 in his first interview with the news organizations since they began reporting on Social Security overpayments and clawbacks months ago. He was elaborating on a statement the committee posted last week. “As the point person for getting this fixed, I’m committing to getting this turned around,” Wyden said. “Your reporting has just been invaluable in terms of kind of opening up a lot of visibility and awareness to something that needs to be fixed.” Wyden is co-sponsor of a Senate bill that would address one of the root causes of overpayments. (WSB-TV, Atlanta) In the Supplemental Security Income program, which provides monthly checks to people who have little or no income or assets and are over 65 or disabled, asset limits for beneficiaries haven’t been adjusted since the 1980s. Those limits stand at $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples. The bill, spearheaded by Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.), to $10,000 and $20,000, respectively, and adjust them for inflation in the future. The bill has seven other , including recent additions Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), chair of the Appropriations Committee. Chief executives of several major Wall Street firms, including Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, expressed support for the bill at a recent hearing, . At a September news conference on Capitol Hill, a representative of JPMorgan Chase, which also backs the proposal, said the asset limits often prevent employees from participating in a 401(k) retirement plan to which the firm makes matching contributions. A in the House of Representatives has 10 lawmakers behind it. “With growing bipartisan support in Congress and among the business and faith communities, we have a good chance to finally get this done,” Brown said in a statement for this article. Subscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing. Legislation to raise the asset limits could be included in a government funding bill early next year, Brown spokesperson Kevin Donohoe said. Wyden said he hopes the legislation becomes a campaign issue in the election year and that candidates are asked whether they support it. The monthly meetings with the Social Security Administration will begin when a new commissioner is in place, Wyden said. President Joe Biden’s nominee to head the agency, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley (D), cleared the Finance Committee and is awaiting a confirmation vote by the full Senate. In a recent hearing, O’Malley said accounts of people facing clawbacks were “heartbreaking” and promised to make the issue a priority. Wyden said he expects the oversight meetings will include the top Republican on the Finance Committee, Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho. A spokesperson for Crapo, Mandi Critchfield, said he “is committed to addressing the overpayments issue, and looks forward to working with Senator Wyden to conduct proper oversight.” One of the goals for those meetings, Wyden said, is to find out whether the agency can do more about overpayments using the legal powers it already has, including the authority to waive debts. Wyden said he has discussed Social Security overpayments and clawbacks with officials at the White House. In the interview, Wyden also addressed a recent report by KFF Health News and CMG that, according to the results of a public records request, the SSA has been sending overpayment notices to over a than the agency’s acting commissioner, Kilolo Kijakazi, . “When you have Social Security officials not telling the truth — and that’s how I would characterize that report on the number of people for whom there was actually a problem — it really damages this incredibly important program’s credibility,” Wyden said. The news organizations obtained a copy of a piece of paper from which Kijakazi read aloud some numbers but not others at the October hearing. SSA spokesperson Nicole Tiggemann said last week the agency could not confirm the accuracy of the counts — those Kijakazi presented at the hearing and those she left out. Meanwhile, senior Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee issued a statement this week on overpayments and clawbacks. “Recent news reports have highlighted that the harm and unfairness Social Security beneficiaries experience after unknowingly being overpaid is more widespread than previously thought,” Reps. John B. Larson of Connecticut and Danny K. Davis of Illinois said. Larson is the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security, and Davis is the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Work and Welfare. “The need for action is clear,” they said. “There must be a fundamental overhaul of Social Security’s overpayment process – one that puts seniors and Americans with severe disabilities first.” While the government is at fault for some overpayments, others result from beneficiaries failing to comply with requirements, intentionally or otherwise. That can include failing to keep the SSA updated about items such as earnings, assets, and in-kind support — for example, whether family members are giving the beneficiary food or a place to stay. Systemic problems also contribute. The SSA has relied on manual systems, and those are subject to human error. Rules are complex and difficult for SSA staff and beneficiaries alike to follow. People who receive yet try to work can easily run afoul of restrictions not only on how much they are allowed to save but also on how much they are allowed to earn. For individuals who aren’t blind, the is $1,470. The SSA relies heavily on beneficiaries to report changes in income, assets, and the like. For instance, the agency has been slow to implement systems that would automatically tap payroll data from outside sources. Beneficiaries and advocates for Social Security recipients say the agency frequently loses information they submit. Getting through to humans at the agency can be extremely difficult, they say. Wait times are long, and calls get dropped. O’Malley, the nominee for commissioner, recently told the Senate Finance Committee that the agency has a “ .” “The current wait times, backlogs, and delays are simply unacceptable,” O’Malley wrote. The agency has cited staffing and funding. In the 2023 fiscal year, “we began to rebuild our workforce after ending FY 2022 with the lowest staffing level in 25 years,” the acting commissioner said in an October statement to a congressional subcommittee. The agency closed field offices during the pandemic. That made it more difficult for beneficiaries to communicate with the SSA, and it caused problems to pile up. The agency checks benefits retrospectively, which , researchers at the Urban Institute have said. Regardless of who was originally at fault, by the time the SSA issues an overpayment notice, years can pass and the alleged overpayment total can balloon. Under federal law, the agency must try to recover overpaid amounts, Kijakazi said in her October statement, and there is no statute of limitations.

        "content": "MADERA, Calif. (KFSN) -- Every Wednesday morning, Jill Campbell scrubs in for her shift at Valley Children's Hospital in Madera. Even after teaching for 40 years, Campbell still wanted retirement to include kids. Campbell is one of about 50 volunteer cuddlers at Valley Children's. It's a position she takes seriously. \"I just love being with the babies,\" she said. \"I love knowing that I can hold the babies when their parents can't be here - and not every family can be here all the time, so that's where I come in. I get to love their babies while they're not here.\" Cuddlers hold, rock and soothe the hospital's tiniest, most critical patients. \"These babies are babies who are usually about three pounds or more,\" says Stacie Venkatesan with Valley Children's. \"We also have a large population of very big babies who have surgical needs, and they often are with us a long time recuperating from their surgeries.\" Campbell will walk the halls of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, listening for a baby who needs some extra care. Cuddlers are trained by neonatal nurses on how to properly hold the infants. Campbell says she can't imagine a better way to spend her day than loving on a precious little boy or girl. \"It is something that gives me purpose,\" she said. Whether it's five minutes or maybe two hours, volunteers' comforting cuddles do serve a purpose. Not only does it allow nurses to provide care to other babies, cuddlers help them develop into healthy babies. \"Their sight and their hearing are all part of being held and being interacted with in a positive way,\" Venkatesan said. Since cuddlers are dealing with some of the most medically-fragile patients, Valley Children's is selective about who can become one. Candidates are promoted from the Patient Pal volunteer group, and there's usually a waitlist to become a cuddler. Campbell ends each shift knowing she made a difference in the lives of the littlest patients - leaving her more fulfilled every day. \"I think everybody should do it,\" she said.

        "description": "South Korea expands telemedicine pilot Starting 15 December, the South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare will be introducing additional measures to its national telemedicine pilot. According to a media statement, the programme is now allowing the conduct of telemedicine services at night and on holidays. Patients who have had face-to-face treatment within the past six months from a clinic can now also access telemedicine. About 100 islands and remote areas where health services remain inaccessible have also been designated as \"medically vulnerable areas\" where telemedicine can also be provided. Moreover, the programme prohibits downloading original prescriptions through a telemedicine application to prevent falsification. Recently, it was brought to the ministry's attention that some providers had prescribed commonly abused medications, violating the telemedicine rule. Synapxe integrates Lunit AI CXR into 2 SingHealth hospitals Singapore General Hospital and Changi General Hospital, both under SingHealth, have recently adopted the AI-based chest X-ray solution from Lunit. Synapxe, Singapore's national health tech agency, has integrated the Lunit INSIGHT CXR into the clinical radiology workflow of the two hospitals through the AimSG, the national AI platform for medical imaging. The integration was initiated through Lunit's partnership with NTT DATA Singapore, which is also part of the AimSG project. It is expected that Lunit's AI will help enhance the hospitals' ability to interpret and diagnose chest diseases. Lunit to buy AI mammography solution Volpara In other related news, Lunit also announced that it is buying New Zealand-based AI mammography solution company Volpara Health Technologies for $193 million. The acquisition will support Lunit's expansion in the United States where Volpara is adopted in over 2,000 medical sites. Absorbing Volpara's repository of over 100 million high-quality mammogram images will also \"supercharge\" the company's AI capabilities, it said.

        "content": "Earlier this week, I went to TGI Fridays for the very first time. I wasn’t there to eat ironically, lambaste the food, or disparage the place outright. Rather, there was something that brought me to TGIF specifically, and it’s the financial data suggesting chain restaurants are once again on the rise. I’ve read the op-eds and essays. , says Eater citing figures that show ’s sales are up, as are . Texas Roadhouse is the in the world, and many fast-casual are trending upward as well. I’m fascinated by this surge in mid-tier chain restaurant dining. Eater puts it this way: Getting good food at a reasonable price isn’t all that easy here in Los Angeles. It’s why eating out for me these days usually involves burritos, , tacos, and . But a sit-down affair? A few drinks and some appetizers? That puts you north of $40 . Hell, finding a mixed drink under $13 is a near impossibility in this sun-soaked city. Still, it’s not necessarily a binary, where your only choices are potato skins or steak au poivre. But Fridays would love for you to see it that way. , it seems like the restaurant wants to showcase its value first and foremost. I wanted to see if that translated to a good meal. I went to Fridays with a friend, chef , around 2 p.m. on a Monday. This particular Fridays is —a giant dining area with a wrap-around bar easily seating 20 people, and plenty of TVs. Fridays is ready to accommodate large parties, throngs of happy hour attendees, and groups of bros eager to watch sporting events. Two o’clock is an odd time to eat and drink, but it’s also the most stress-free time to go to any restaurant. The emptiness was comforting, but the physical space of Fridays is where the words “empty” and “comfort” stop finding common ground. The prices at Fridays are, at face value, mind-blowingly good: $3.79 for truffle tot-chos, chips and jalapeño ranch for $3, mozzarella sticks for $5.59, and buffalo chicken slammers for $5.99, to name a few. The chain has a huge menu, full of subsections like small plates, appetizers, shareables, entrées, burgers and sandwiches, wings, salads, soups, bowls, a sushi and Asian-inspired section called Krispy Rice, and an expansive drink menu. Previously, I had thought that “small plates,” “appetizers,” and “shareables” were all words used interchangeably, but at Fridays, the menu clarifies the distinctions: Small plates serve 1 person, appetizers serve 2-3, and shareables serve 4-6. The clear, recommended feeding portions is refreshing. You don’t have to worry about over- or under-ordering. Despite the wealth of options, I have always assumed that Fridays is all about appetizers, and the best thing I ate was surely the mozzarella sticks. Though the cheese itself tasted barely of anything, the low-moisture mozzarella pull was absolutely delightful. Look how happy the pull made me. This is what food is supposed to do. The mozzarella sticks were the highlight, however, because most of the food just didn’t taste like it’s supposed to. The meatballs tasted remarkably unlike beef. I have never tasted meat that tastes less like meat in my life. This isn’t some gate-keeping review of TGI Fridays, but yes, words like “rubbery,” “bland,” and “greasy” come to mind. The two tiny meatballs cost $4.99. That’s not a good deal. The truffle tot-chos were crunchy and fun, but also absolutely fumigated with truffle oil. They smell toxic—these little croquettes should come with a gas mask. Is that harsh? Pretentious? Maybe, but look pal, I’m not the one using truffle oil here. Fridays’ use of truffle oil reminds me of the first time my nephew called me a shithead. It was funny once, and yes, my own behaviors taught you to do this, but knock it off right now, man. What’s a buffalo chicken slammer? Essentially, it’s a fried chicken tender stuffed into a mini lobster roll bun. This is a really fun idea, and the type of thing that would have been delicious if executed well. But the slammers were a disappointment because the presentation suggested the promise of delicious, fucked-up whimsy. Instead, they were just bland, and again, the price for portion wasn’t that great here. You know what else I can get for $6? Two amazing al pastor tacos, or one of the best slices of in the city. The one saving grace at Fridays was the booze. I ordered an espresso martini, which was so intensely sugary it tasted like it was intended for children. Still, it’s not the worst espresso martini I’ve had by a long shot, and for $10, it’s a damn good deal. Drinks at Fridays are cheap, which is great, because you should be very drunk there. All of the food I ate at Fridays was unseasoned, taste-avoidant, and unsatisfying. These harsh criticisms raise questions within myself. Am I an asshole for wanting the food to be better? When did I suddenly set a high bar for Fridays? I reckon the moment I walked through the door. Whether it’s a chain or not, there exist certain expectations for restaurant-quality food the moment you sit down to enjoy a meal, and that’s true no matter what type of establishment it is. I’ve been searching for some sort of profound thing to say after eating at Fridays, some sort of meaning to glean from the experience itself, and I think it’s this: It’s totally fine to like things, but it’s also okay to hate things. It’s okay to hate a restaurant’s food as long as that hate comes from a place of actually wanting to improve it. I don’t begrudge anybody for enjoying Fridays, and I have no interest in dunking on it for sport. But I do want everyone to have their fair share of seasoning. Affordable, flavorful food should be an option for everybody. To accept that it only exists when corporate dining overlords decide it’s comfortably within their margins is less than we deserve. Sometimes, you need a meal to wash down a meal. After Fridays, Lo and I went to , a celebrated taco truck a few miles away. What we received there wasn’t a bounty of photo-ready fried appetizers, but it was delicious, satisfying, expertly made, and cheap. Two shrimp tacos and six freshly shucked oysters cost $18. “There is a reason it’s loved in the community,” said Lo. People know they can go to Mariscos Jalisco for a reasonably priced meal, and they won’t even have to decode the difference between appetizers and shareables to get it.",

        "content": "Since the federal government took an “All the King’s horses and All the King’s men” approach to overcoming the 2022 infant formula shortage, it’s a little surprising that there is still something major to do about it. But there is. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is publishing a final rule to implement the so-called “Access to Baby Formula Act.” It was signed into law on May 21, 2022. The Formula Act was part of the months-long, whole-of-government response to the “recall-driven” infant formula shortages in 2022, The new law is supposed to provide access to the formula for WIC participants, even in unforeseen circumstances like disasters and emergencies, in addition to supply chain disruptions. FNS’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is the largest purchaser of infant formula in the United States. WIC’s market dominance, at the time when shortages became severe, contributed to the multi-billion dollar industry being controlled by just four companies that controlled 90 percent of the market. One of those four was Abbott Nutrition, which temporarily shut down out of concern for food safety. FNS claims to take its role in caring for families exceptionally seriously, including ensuring the people served by our programs, including WIC, have access to the safe, healthy foods they need to thrive. FNS also says it’s been working since the Access to Baby Formula Act was passed to implement the law as a final rule to strengthen and guide its response to any future baby formula-related challenges. This final rule will implement permanent, expanded authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to waive or modify specific legal requirements to help ensure the continuity of WIC services during emergencies and supply chain disruptions with an impact on WIC. It also adds requirements for WIC state agencies to include language in their WIC infant formula cost containment contracts that describe flexibilities available to WIC state agencies in case of an infant formula recall and how an infant formula manufacturer would protect against disruption of access to infant formula. Further, the final rule ensures that WIC state agencies anticipate and prepare for events that may disrupt normal program operations to reduce impacts on participants when an event does happen. The rule was scheduled to be published on Dec. 14 and will be open for public comment for 60 days, closing on Feb. 12. FNS is requesting comments on this rule through Feb. 12, 2024, to inform it of any future rules, policies, and guidance related to infant formula to ensure its best support of the WIC population regardless of what circumstances arise. The infant formula shortage lasted for months, leaving many parents on their own to find supply, sometimes across multiple states. Recalls for Cronobaqcter sakazakii illnesses associated with powdered infant formula contributed to the national shortage. The national shortage forced the Biden Administration to open its domestic formula market to the supply from imports. Almost no foreign formula was allowed into the U.S. previously.

        "content": "There are now 241 complaints from patrons of a sushi restaurant in Raleigh, NC, about foodborne illnesses. The complaints against Sushi Nine began Nov. 28, according to local health department officials. The suspected pathogen is norovirus, with at least three restaurant customers testing positive. The number of sick people is growing quickly with 100 more reporting becoming sick since the previous update on Dec, 9. Wake County Public Health and Wake County Environmental Services are investigating the outbreak. “Unfortunately, norovirus can spread very easily, especially during holiday gatherings and parties, which include a lot of meal prep and catering,” Wake County Public Health Director Rebecca Kaufman said. “We continue to work closely with customers who visited Sushi Nine, restaurant staff and our partners with NCDHHS (North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services) to determine the source and extent of the outbreak.” Owners of Sushi Nine closed the restaurant for two days for cleaning, but it has since reopened. About norovirus Symptoms of norovirus infection may include vomiting and/or diarrhea, nausea, muscle aches, fever, and headache, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms typically start 12 to 48 hours after exposure and can last for one to three days. Most people recover without treatment, however some may need medical attention for dehydration. People with norovirus infections can spread the infection easily to others. The virus can live on surfaces for long periods of time.

        "content": "More information has been shared by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) about Salmonella in poultry meat and eggs from Poland. There have been 200 cases of salmonellosis this year in the United Kingdom caused by different strains of Salmonella Enteritidis linked to such products. FSA has investigated more than 90 incidents in the past two years, with two outbreaks linked to eggs and three to poultry meat from Poland this year. The FSA, Food Standards Scotland (FSS), and the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) recently told consumers to take care when handling and cooking chicken, turkey, and duck products at home. Catering sites are using the majority of imported eggs. Repeated problems frustrate FSA Emily Miles, FSA chief executive, and Christine Middlemiss, chief veterinary officer, wrote a letter to the European Commission and the chief veterinary officer in Poland to flag the rise in cases involving Polish poultry and eggs. Information on the number of establishments involved was shared with Polish authorities. “Each time we have detected a specific food safety concern we have acted promptly to keep consumers safe, but we are unhappy about the repeated occurrences,” said Miles. An incident management group has been created to coordinate activities across government departments, including Defra and UKHSA, to move efforts from responding on a case-by-case basis to a more holistic approach. FSA said the Poland problem comes when it is experiencing an unexpected spike in other incidents and outbreaks. As part of the Border Target Operating Model (BTOM), pre-notifications would be required for EU commodities beginning at the end of January. Physical checks are planned beginning in April. However, it is possible to use existing regulations to do additional controls earlier if necessary. The British Poultry Council (BPC) wants to see authorities checking every load from Poland and rejecting those not meeting requirements. Richard Griffiths, BPC chief executive, said: “We have long established and rigorous processes to deal with Salmonella, and we follow these to the letter to produce food people trust and value. It is disappointing that Poland cannot do the same and is willing to export its hygiene problems instead of dealing with them.” The UK Office for Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Trade Assurance is undertaking an audit of Poland in April 2024 to evaluate the controls in place. In November, the UK hosted the annual Trade Specialised Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures under the EU/UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement. FSA requested discussions on improving cooperation and information sharing on food safety incidents. Talks are expected to be held in early 2024. E. coli outbreak due to animal contact Meanwhile, the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) was part of a team investigating a Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) human outbreak that was epidemiologically linked to an animal-contact visitor attraction. In a report covering activities from July to September, the agency said STEC O157 and STEC O26 were behind the outbreak. Environmental sampling at the premises detected STEC O26 in a children’s play area; other areas were also positive for STEC. E. coli was confirmed in all 32 samples of animal feces taken. Although some STECs were detected, they were not O157 or O26. The site closed voluntarily after being told of human illnesses. Local authority and APHA visits identified deficiencies in compliance with the relevant industry code of practice. The most common issues at animal contact attractions include suboptimal handwashing facilities, poor supervision of animal contact, contamination of walkways with soiled animal bedding or feces, and unclear marking of animal contact versus non-contact areas. Work at the premises to rectify deficiencies improved the situation before a phased reopening. APHA also said there were no cryptosporidiosis investigations during the third quarter of 2023.

        "content": "Food safety was either the top or the second most important thing when buying food for people in Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Kosovo. In Kosovo, 57 percent said food safety was the main factor, with cost being second. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, cost was first with 64 percent, followed by food safety with 54 percent. It is the first Eurobarometer food safety poll to include people’s views in Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Kosovo. Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Turkey also took part in the survey, commissioned by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), in 2019. These seven countries are aiming to join the EU at some point in the future. Bosnia and Herzegovina findings The survey in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo was carried out between May and June 2023, with more than 2,000 respondents from different social and demographic groups being interviewed face-to-face in their language. Overall, 69 percent of respondents in Bosnia and Herzegovina said they were personally interested in food safety, compared to the EU average of 70 percent. People had mainly heard about additives like colors, preservatives, or flavorings used in food or drinks and food poisoning from items contaminated by bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The latter was also a major concern of citizens, alongside genetically modified ingredients. The top reason given not to engage with food safety was “I know enough to avoid or mitigate food risks.” Barbara Gallani, head of EFSA’s communications and partnership department, said: “Together with our partners in EU member states and in pre-accession countries our cooperation on communication has benefitted from generating insights from social research like the Eurobarometer. “We can better understand the concerns and needs of audiences to help make our communications more impactful. This collaboration is already bearing fruit for use in campaigns we run jointly and as input for our national partners when they need to communicate directly with their citizens.” Kosovo results A total of 78 percent of respondents in Kosovo said they were interested in the topic of food safety, which was above the EU average. Participants mainly had heard and were concerned about food poisoning from items contaminated by bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Reasons not to engage with food safety were split between taking it for granted food was safe, knowing enough to avoid or mitigate risks, and finding food safety information highly technical and complex. A recent assessment of food safety control systems by the European Commission found Bosnia and Herzegovina had a way to go to meet EU standards. While Kosovo had made progress, the country’s food agency needed more financial and human resources. EFSA is also running a tender process to help pre-accession countries build capacities to address future food-related crises. These nations include Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo , Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey. One of the objectives is to develop annual training plans and materials, covering two-day workshops in 2024, 2025, and 2026 with different training formats such as case studies, desktop exercises, and mock exercises, plus a simulation covering an urgent response to a multi-country animal or public health outbreak related to biological hazards, animal health and welfare, plant health, and chemical hazards. Expected outcomes of the training are enhanced urgent response capacities in risk assessment and risk communication and improved crisis preparedness procedures. The tender process is open until Jan. 2, 2024. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here .)",

        "description": "Has your place been looking a little . . . clogged up lately? Well, it may be time to do some organizing! The new year is the perfect time to declutter, streamline, and organize your space so that you can tackle all the other goals you have for 2024. If you want some help to get started, look no further: we've got the 12 golden rules of decluttering all laid out for you below. 1. Get rid of duplicates If you have duplicates lying around, get rid of them if they are not necessary. Keep the better duplicate and trash or donate the other. 2. Get rid of things you haven't used in a year So you keep telling yourself that you'll use it eventually. But if you haven't touched it in a year, chances are that you're not going to in the near future. Do your home a favor and get rid of the items that aren't getting any use. 3. Digitize nostalgic items Do you have too many nostalgic items that you can't seem to get yourself to give away? Take photos of them and then get rid of them - you'll be able to keep them around forever without cluttering up your space. 4. Don't keep items out of guilt I'm sure you have a thing or two around the house that you keep out of guilt. Perhaps it's a sweater sweet aunt Betty knitted for you for Christmas that you never wear or that fancy dress you splurged way too much on. Time to be brutal and get rid of them all. 5. Put things back where they belong It's easy to just leave things lying around, but that's how clutter builds up. After you're done using something, immediately put it back where it belongs so you won't procrastinate. 6. And find a home for them Make sure every item in your home has a place, whether it's a plastic container or an under-the-bed organizer. And remember: a pile of items is not a true place for your things. 7. Sell, give away, donate, upcycle, or throw away When assessing things you want to get rid of, start by seeing if you can make some of your money back by selling it. If you don't think it's worth the effort to sell, give it away to people you know who will use it. Perhaps to your family and friends, or even your Facebook network. You can also choose to donate it to get a tax write-off. 8. Don't keep items you wouldn't buy now Are there some items you have that you would never buy now? Perhaps you should take a good hard look at them and figure out why you need them now and if you can do without them. 9. Opt for covered furniture If you have a clutter problem, choose furniture that is covered, such as a closet with a sliding door instead of open shelves. This will help your place look cleaner and more organized. 10. Don't forget storage under your bed There's a lot of real estate in your home that's not being put to good use; one that people often forget about is under-the-bed storage. 11. Think tall Use up all the space in your home to make the most of it, including the vertical space. The more space you have for your stuff, the less likely it's going to get cluttered up. 12. Evaluate your spending If you're buying things you don't need, take a hard look at your spending. Perhaps you need to take part in a 30-day spending hiatus to motivate yourself.

        "content": "Retailer lists are now available for peaches, nectarines and plums linked to a Listeria outbreak that has killed one person and sickened others. Samples from sick people were collected from Aug. 22, 2018, to Aug. 16, this year. The outbreak is considered ongoing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The sick people are spread across seven states and all of them have required hospitalization. Whole genome sequencing has allowed public health officials to match patients across several years, all with the outbreak strait of Listeria monocytogenes. The Food and Drug Administration has also found the pathogen on samples of peaches from the producer. Anyone who ate recalled peaches, plums or nectarines in recently should monitor themselves for seven weeks after eating the fruit for signs of Listeria infection. Symptoms are listed below. The FDA continues to work to find out what retailers may have received recalled fruit associated with this outbreak. The agency has released a list of retailers and the states where the recalled fruit has been distributed. The fruit is past its sell-by date, but there is concern that consumers may have frozen some of it for future use. The recalled fruit was distributed to the following stores and states: In response to this investigation, HMC Farms has voluntarily recalled all of its peaches, plums, and nectarines sold in retail stores from May 1, 2022, through Nov. 15, 2022, and from May 1, 2023, through Nov. 15, 2023. The recalled fruit was sold at retail stores as individual pieces of fruit bearing PLU stickers or in consumer packaging; however, the recalled fruit is no longer available for sale and any previously purchased fruit should be past shelf life. If you previously purchased recalled fresh peaches, plums and nectarines and then froze them, you should throw them away if they are part of the recall or if you cannot tell if they are part of the recall. Fresh whole peaches, plums, and nectarines currently available for sale at retail are not included in this recall. About Listeria infections Food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections. Anyone who has eaten any of the recalledfruitand developed symptoms of Listeria infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible Listeria exposure. Also, anyone who has eaten any of the recalled products should monitor themselves for symptoms during the coming weeks because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to Listeria for symptoms of listeriosis to develop. Symptoms of Listeria infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache, and neck stiffness. Specific laboratory tests are required to diagnose Listeria infections, which can mimic other illnesses. Pregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people such as cancer patients who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections, and other complications. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or even stillbirth.

        "content": "The Biden administration is investing billions in passenger rail, giving a boost to a potentially important tool for mitigating climate change. However, significant hurdles could slow efforts to get more rail online. Last week, President Biden in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding for 10 passenger rail projects, including what the White House described as the “first world-class high-speed rail projects in our country’s history.” The funded projects include a line connecting California to Las Vegas — which alone is expected to carry 11 million passengers each year and prevent 400,000 tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere — as well as lines serving California’s Central Valley, North Carolina and a line connecting Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Va. Experts, the rail industry and environmentalists say that passenger trains could be an important tool for getting people out of cars and planes, thereby helping the planet. “As long as it helps get people from Point A to Point B, we will see less car trips on the road,” said Rebekah Whilden, deputy director of Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All campaign. She added that a reduction in travel in personal vehicles is “ultimately what we need to see to see the emissions reductions that we need.” Nick Little, director of railway education at Michigan State University’s Center For Railway Research and Education, said there is potential to grow more rail in the U.S., but only in “selective” locations. He said that opportunities exist in the northeastern U.S., as well as to connect the Dallas-Fort Worth area to Houston and Austin in Texas and Chicago to cities including Detroit, Grand Rapids, Mich., and Minneapolis. However, the future of rail may not look like the ambitious high-speed rail maps that , illustrating fantasies of connecting the entire nation: Such ideas are a “pipe dream,” Little said. The U.S. Department of Transportation has its for passenger trains. It identifies parts of the Northeast and California as places for “frequent trains at 125-250+ mph in the nation’s densest and most populous regions” and parts of the Midwest as areas for regional service connecting large and midsize cities as well as “feeder” services to connect communities to the rail network. Christopher Barkan, professor and director of the Rail Transportation and Engineering Center at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said that he expects rail to grow in the years ahead, noting that there’s already significant work underway. He said he mostly expects it to crop up in corridors between 100 and 400 miles in length. “It’s a combination of population density and suitable distances where both conventional and high-speed passenger [rail] can be competitive,” Barkan said. Andy Kunz, president of the U.S. High Speed Rail Association, said “the prognosis is really good” for the future of high-speed rail. “The really good thing is, the Brightline West one, which will connect Las Vegas and Los Angeles, that one will be up and running in four short years,” Kurz said. “It’ll make the case much sooner to the American people how great of a transportation mode this actually is,” he added, saying that another California project is expected to take longer to build. However, he said that building out high-speed rail in the Northeast is “going to be one of the harder ones to build because they’ll have to build a whole new set of tracks” in order to handle the high speeds. Meanwhile, Little said that he particularly expects to see more frequent trains on existing routes going forward because it’s “an easy thing to do, relatively,” since the trains themselves are the only additional expense. But for new rail, there are still hurdles to overcome. Barkan said the nation’s environmental review process — sometimes known as permitting — is one hurdle. “The initial thing that takes time is the environmental permitting,” he said. “That’s actually one of the things I think the United States needs to improve is to accelerate its environmental permitting process for projects such as this.” Permitting is also a hot topic on Capitol Hill — where lawmakers have sought to make a deal to speed up energy and other infrastructure projects. As part of a deal to lift the debt ceiling, some changes such as shorter federal environmental reviews were approved earlier this year, but lawmakers do not appear to have moved closer on a broader agreement. Kunz said that not having enough funding for rail projects is the “No. 1 reason” for delays. “Not having the money readily available early, the project ends up slowing down or actually stopping and waiting for the money to come in,” he said. This, in turn, drives up the bill for projects because of inflation and increased costs. Barkan said the grants announced last week will be “a significant help,” but more is needed. “We’re not done yet, but it’s a huge step forward.” Whilden, with the Sierra Club, said the nation’s rail system might be able to get a boost not only from money allocated by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, but also through more in the Inflation Reduction Act. “Municipalities and states can apply for it, and basically the only kind of checkbox is that it has to lower … pollution emissions, and so rail could be seen as being able to be used for that sort of grant,” Whilden said.",

        "content": "December 15, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread by Paula RAMON Jaguars don't understand borders, but where the United States meets Mexico, they are having to adapt to them. Once the master of the Sonoran Desert, the animal is now struggling to survive in a landscape cut in two by a wall. The barrier, which former US president Donald Trump boasted he would make \"impenetrable,\" does little to discourage the thousands of people from Latin America, Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe who arrive in the country every day, fleeing poverty and persecution. But, say conservationists, the fencing erected by successive administrations in Washington is deadly to wildlife. \"One of the most important things for the health of ecosystems is habitat connectivity ,\" says Laiken Jordahl from the Center for Biological Diversity. \"Animals need to be able to roam, to find food, water, to find mates. Having wide expanses of connected landscape is critical.\" A metal fence rises 30 feet (9 meters) at the southern edge of the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, a 117,000-acre (47,000-hectare) home for threatened and endangered plants and animals in Arizona. The barrier marks the end of the United States, but not the end of the habitat for dozens of species, including American antelope, mule deer, lynx, mountain lions and jaguars. \"This wall is clearly going to sever this entire ecosystem from all of the wild lands in Mexico that will make animals on this side and that side of the wall more vulnerable to drought, to climate change , to inbreeding,\" Jordahl said. Scientists think there are about 150 jaguars on the Mexican side; there have been only seven documented sightings on the American side in recent decades. \"One individual jaguar can roam hundreds or thousands of acres, they can walk hundreds of miles in a matter of days. They need massive landscapes available to them,\" said Jordahl. \"Jaguars are coming up to Arizona from Sonora in Mexico, but a lot of them are being met with a solid border wall.\" 'Undercutting' A physical barrier at the US-Mexico border has been in the works for decades along stretches of the 2,000-mile (3,000-kilometer) frontier. It is present in national parks , nature reserves and on indigenous lands in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California, ending a few yards (meters) out into the Pacific Ocean. Each piece of the jigsaw reveals the administration that put it there—Trump's section of wall, for example, stands the highest, a reflection of the Republican's signature pledge to shutter the border. Trump's White House repealed or circumvented rules designed to lessen environmental impacts, causing \"irreparable\" damage in nature reserves and on indigenous lands, according to a report released in September by the Government Accountability Office, the auditing arm of Congress. Democrat Joe Biden halted the expansion of the wall when he came to office in 2021, but in October his administration authorized the closing of some gaps, mainly in Arizona. For Jordahl, the rush to erect the barrier undermined years of careful conservation work by the government. \"The federal government has put hundreds of millions of dollars into protecting landscapes around the border, into recovering animals like the Mexican gray wolf and the jaguar. \"But at the same time, they're undercutting all of those goals by building this impermeable structure that stops... migrations dead in their tracks. \"Essentially, we're pulling thread after thread out of this patchwork that is the intact ecosystem,\" said Jordahl. \"It's only a matter of time until it all does start to unravel.\" © 2023 AFP",

        "content": "December 14, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by University of Colorado at Boulder When it comes to the Colorado River, history often repeats itself—but it doesn't have to. That's the take-home message from CU Boulder hydrologist Shemin Ge, who will present a little-known piece of history from the river this Thursday at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting in San Francisco. The story of hydrologist Eugene Clyde La Rue, Ge said, may help to explain the current water crisis facing many states in the American West. Ge's presentation centers around a decision made in 1922 when the seven men who made up the Colorado River Commission came to an agreement to divvy up water on the Colorado River. This waterway winds over 1,450 miles and through seven states. The commission relied on an estimate from the U.S. Reclamation Service suggesting that 16.4 million acre-feet of water ran through the river at Lees Ferry, Arizona, every year. (An acre-foot equals the amount of water you'd need to submerge an acre of land to a depth of 1 foot). But, Ge said, the commission also failed to consider a second, less convenient study from 1916. Relying on his own field data, La Rue, working for the U.S. Geological Survey, had calculated that the Colorado River discharged just 15 million acre-feet of water . \"It's intriguing how such good work at the time was ignored, whether it was intentional or just out of ignorance,\" said Ge, professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at CU Boulder. She worries it may be happening again. In 2022, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, the two main reservoirs on the Colorado River, dried up to levels never seen before, raising concerns that they could be heading for a \"dead pool\" state—in which water could flow in but not out of the reservoirs. Currently, the seven states within the Colorado River Compact are working to revise a suite of agreements and guidelines by 2026. Ge hopes that this time, leaders will work closely with scientists and a range of community members, particularly Indigenous groups—all to build a Law of the River that accounts for how much water actually exists in the West, now and in the future. That will become more important, she said, as climate change continues to melt the West's dwindling snowpacks. \"There's so much we can learn from history to improve how we're managing our water,\" Ge said. \"Right now, I don't think we're doing enough.\" She first learned about La Rue's story from the 2019 book, \" Science Be Dammed \" by Eric Kuhn and John Fleck. She and her colleagues wrote about their insights this summer in the magazine \"Eos.\" Think of it as a tale of two estimates. Beginning in 1914, La Rue hiked across much of the river and its tributaries, collecting first-hand data on the flow of water. That included taking measurements of the depth of the river and its flow speed. \"We still do this in our Intro to Geology courses,\" Ge said. \"It's very low-tech, but elegant.\" To come to its 16.4 million acre-feet assessment, in contrast, the Colorado River Commission, led by Secretary of Commerce and future President Herbert Hoover, relied on a much less rigorous study: measurements taken at just one site near Yuma, Arizona, hundreds of miles south of Lees Ferry. \"They took the larger number,\" Ge said. \"A larger number probably made the allocations easier to negotiate because there was more water to divvy up.\" The 40 million people who depend on the Colorado River for their water today may be paying the price. Today, research pegs the flow of the Colorado River at around 13 million acre-feet per year, making even La Rue's modest estimates seem like a fantasy. The Colorado River Compact, however, continues to allot water based on the 16.4 million acre-feet value: Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming together claim 7.5 million acre-feet. Arizona, California, and Nevada get the same, and Mexico supposedly draws 1.4 million. Ge hopes that, in the lead-up to 2026, those seven states will do what Hoover couldn't—draw on the best available science to develop realistic estimates of how much water will likely flow down the river decades from now. She added that Indigenous groups need to be an important part of that process. Several tribes hold some of the most senior rights to water in the western U.S. but lack the infrastructure to access much of their share. \"We're not talking enough about how much water is in the Colorado River,\" Ge said. \"We talk about droughts, infrastructure, and water conservation. But shouldn't the first order of business be to see how much water we actually have? It's much less than we think.\" More information: Abstract: Learning from history in reallocating the Colorado River Provided by University of Colorado at Boulder",

        "content": "Discovery-owned Eurosport has acquired streaming rights in 54 countries to Olympic refugee documentary “ We Dare to Dream ” by Waad Al-Kateab, the Oscar-nominated Syrian director of “For Sama.” “We Dare to Dream” is the story of the refugee Olympic team that competed at the 2020 games in Tokyo, which featured stateless athletes from Iran, Syria, South Sudan and Cameroon who swim, run and fight their way to safety in host nations across the world. It’s told through the personal prism of Al-Kateab while she is coming to terms with the reality that she can never return to Aleppo, where she shot “For Sama.” The doc premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in June and had an Oscar-qualifying theatrical run at New York City’s IFC Center in October. After the doc premiered at Tribeca, Angelina Jolie joined “We Dare to Dream” as an executive producer to help with its Oscar push. Five months later, John Legend also signed on to exec produce with his Get Lifted Film banner co-founders Mike Jackson and Ty Stiklorious. Legend also wrote, composed and performed an original song for the doc, titled “Don’t Need to Sleep.” Peacock acquired U.S. rights to “We Dare to Dream” earlier this month. Peacock and NBC are official U.S. broadcasters of the Olympics, while Eurosport is home of the Olympic Games in Europe. Besides Eurosport play across Europe and beyond – the deal also includes some non-EU territories such as Turkey, Ukraine and Uzbekistan – streaming availability of “We Dare to Dream” will now also comprise Discovery+ in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom and Ireland. “I’m so grateful to Eurosport for bringing this film to 54 countries across the world,” said Al-Kateab in a statement. “I hope people will now be able to understand how the world’s refugees, like me, are not the crisis but rather a result of several global crises from political violence to climate change that are making millions of refugees, like me, face unimaginable challenges.” In her conversation with Jolie about “We Dare to Dream,” Al-Kateab notes that “the sports element is very important in the film; but it’s not about that. Even being refugees themselves, it was very important and played a big part, but [it] wasn’t about that at all. I think for me – what I really wanted people to take away from the film – is what comes after? What’s going to happen to these people after this experience?” Jolie said that “what brings displaced people together is so different and so extraordinary” and points out that there are “110 million people in the world that understand what it is to be forced from their homeland and to live displaced.” She continued, “I was very moved when I realized there was a refugee Olympic team, because to me it is a country in many ways.” Watch the full conversation below.",

        "content": "Another rotation around the sun means another year stacked with memes. But considering how fast-paced the world of social media can be, you’d be forgiven for not remembering viral tweet or trend that had you chuckling under the covers at odd hours of the morning this year. So, to help jog your memory, has rounded up the best memes of 2023. Whether you’re here to relive the glory days of the Barbenheimer phenomenon or experience another level of second-hand cringe at the words follow along as we unveil the best memes of the year. Gag City What’s Gag City, you ask? Ahead of releasing , tweeted a captioned “Approaching Gag City.” Quick to respond (and start a new meme), the Barbz conjured images of the rose-tinted metropolis using AI—even going so far as to assign political leadership to it (with Minaj, of course, the leader). Pingu Dead-Staring to Mozart The likes of Mozart and Beethoven could not have possibly imagined their compositions backing silly little videos of animated penguins on billions of phones across the world. The thought makes it all the funnier when I see Pingu, a kids’ show character, staring wide-eyed as Mozart’s “Lacrimosa” plays. HUH Cat Who doesn’t love a cat meme? When you don’t understand something, or just can’t hear the person talking to you and need them to repeat themselves for the third time in a row, referencing the “HUH?” cat will get your point across. I’m Just a Girl To clarify, no, this is not a play on Julia Roberts’s monologue. “I’m just a girl” emerged as a reaction to the crushing burdens of modern womanhood, justifying a certain kind of indulgence. Why are you tired between 3 and 5 p.m.? Why do you deserve a coffee and sweet treat in the middle of the day,? Because you’re just a girl trying to make it all work. Squirtle Playing the Saxophone That’s it! That’s the meme. It’s a Pokémon with sunglasses, blowing away on the saxophone to the tune of “Run Away” by SunStroke Project. The mirrors a of “Epic Sax Guy” doing the same, and it’s just a mood. Who’s That Wonderful Girl? Could She Be Any Cuter? Thank you to whoever started this meme for forcing me to listen to some positive affirmations. The viral clip comes from , an old Canadian children’s show. DJ Khalid Says the Darndest Things Call me Tiger Woods, because I’m about to drive this point home: I’ve been reprimanded far too many times for saying “LET’S GO GOLFING” in the tone of DJ Khalid, and it’s all because of this internet meme. Someone out there thought it was a good idea to “bring out the whole ocean” of DJ Khalid’s most out-of-pocket, out-of-context sayings, and the result is perfect: Usher, EryKah Badu, and Quavo Front Row at Marni What’s better than one star’s masterclass in fashion-week dressing? A group serve. The three performers were front row at Marni’s spring 2024 show in head-turning ’fits—and once the images hit the web, they immediately took off. Vince McMahon Tearing Up Not much needs to be said about this meme except it’s too real. The clip comes from a documentary in which former WWE CEO Vince McMahon is asked how much wrestling champion The Undertaker meant to him. Overwhelmed with emotion, McMahon motions to cut the cameras. Online, users coopted the moment for their own objects of nostalgic longing. Josh Hutcherson Rick Rolls the Internet Move over, Rick Astley, because Gen-Z Netizens have officially dubbed this of Josh Hutcherson the modern Rickroll. As a die-hard fan who witnessed the birth of videos like these in real time (#TeamPeeta), it’s no surprise a piece of fan history has reclaimed its rightful place at the forefront of internet virality. AI Cartoons Characters in Their Feelings Social media users have found all kinds of creative uses for artificial intelligence. What began—controversially—with some using AI to make their favorite artists sing songs from other musicians (or even rap original music), the internet has moved on to depicting their favorite cartoon characters in their feelings, at the top of their game, or simply balling out. This Stock Photo of Kevin James Caption a photo of Kevin James dressed as his character from , looking sheepishly at the camera with his hands in his pockets, and you have yourself a viral meme. Video of Jeremy Allen White Since became a hit, many started pulling clips of from his days. One went viral simply for the off-centered stare White gives the camera. Cats at the Met Gala The Met Gala always attracts attention online, as people breathlessly check how their favorite stars interpreted the theme. At this year’s event, Doja Cat and Lil Nas X seemed to take the cake with their glittery feline ensembles. Ariana DeBose at the BAFTAs The star’s monologue-rap at the BAFTAs sparked a number of cringe-filled reactions, but one thing viewers couldn’t seem to forget was the vague lyric “Angela Bassett did the thing.” Dylan Sprouse and Barbara Palvin Marry When photos of went viral online, users congratulated the couple in a funny, nostalgic way, citing Sprouse’s days promoting the when he was a Disney Channel star. All Gen-Z kids can remember trying—and failing—to win. When Everyone Started Dissecting the Physics of A lot of hilarious internet discourse ensues when one user poses a question that goes absolutely viral. In this case, it was when @KevOnStage , “What was the moment Fast and Furious abandoned reality.” The internet had a lot to say—and a lot of content to work with, since the franchise is at 10 films and counting. Taylor Swift Fans Take Ticketmaster Down “Ticketmaster-gate” will go down in history as the time Swifties toppled Ticketmaster; fans sued the company after they were unable to buy tickets to Swift’s Eras Tour. The fracas garnered a from Taylor Swift herself, and not only resulted in a lawsuit but also . Breaks the Internet Shoutout to ’s marketing team for their master class in social media mayhem ahead of the film’s July release. For a period of time, you couldn’t go online without seeing something related to the bleach-blonde doll; from memes like “Hi Barbie” to “She’s everything, he’s just Ken,” ’s relevance lasted years in internet terms. When posters for the film were first revealed, the internet wasted no time casting their own favs into the mix. After fans learned that and would be released on the same day, they joked about watching the two back to back, citing the humorously stark contrast between the rose-colored feel-good film and serious historical biopic. Then fans then started comparing Barbenheimer to with seemingly opposite vibes. One ticket to and anyone? Even Margot Robbie and Cillian Murphy seemed to get in on the fun… fans also meme-d about the funny character dynamics in the film, specifically between Barbie, with her capacity to be and do everything, and…Ken. This format went viral, too: Twitter Is Now “X” When Elon Musk announced Twitter’s rebrand to “X,” many users weren’t happy, clowning on the change that no one signed up for. Astro Boy Boots Is this where the trend started? Once the internet caught wind of these cartoonish red boots from MSCHF, the memes sort of wrote themselves. Stop Normalizing the Grind… Romanticizing anything that resembled the quiet life—a cozy-girl mentality, a sleepy woodland animal—became a trend. Because, frankly, there something beautifully aspirational about a picture of Winnie the Pooh wrapped up in a blanket drinking tea. Iterations of the meme also come in the form of “the sexual tension between me and [insert cozy activity here],” and “the feminine urge to…” Honk Shoo-ing In the vein of romanticizing coziness, the vibe of the SleepyTime Tea Bear became universally coveted this year. “Honk shoo,” the sound a fictional bear might make while passed out in an armchair, appeared in almost every tweet that described emulating the tea bear’s sensibility. Some even took it a step further, and tried to “steal his look”—making outfit breakdowns a part of the meme too. Pedro Pascal and Nicholas Cage This clip from went viral, as social media users latched on to Pedro Pascal’s wholesome demeanor and Nicholas Cage’s outrageous stare. They’re Playing Football During a Rihanna Concert Considering Rihanna’s Super Bowl Halftime show was the halftime performance of all time, it’s not a surprise that the internet was in a frenzy before, during, and after what people jokingly called a Rihanna concert…with some football.",

        "content": "As we prepare for the sight of Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa, here's a look back at his career arc from romantic leading man to whatever it is he's doing now When you’ve been in the moviemaking business for as long as Hugh Grant has, you’ve earned the right to take whatever kinds of chances you want in the roles you choose. If that means poking a little fun at your own image as an aging, curmudgeonly actor whose best roles may be behind him (though we’d argue that’s certainly not true) or going completely off the rails as a digitally created Oompa Loompa in the new film, that’s your prerogative. After years of struggling to get away from the kinds of romantic roles he was being offered after his breakthrough performance in , it’s been fascinating to track the progression of Grant’s projects as he continues to push boundaries on his own terms. If he ever cared what audiences thought of him, he certainly doesn’t anymore. And lately it seems as if he’s found a new sort of niche that suits him. That doesn’t mean we love his performances in beloved rom-coms like and any less. He’s an actor of many talents. Here, then, are our favorite Hugh Grant performances ranging from the most stable characters to the most delightfully unhinged. 2 / 17 15. (1999) 15. (1999) Hugh Grant’s humble London-based bookseller Will in is as stable as they come—that’s the whole point of the character (it’s Rhys Ifans who gets to be truly unhinged here as his flatmate Spike). Will is a grounding presence in the looking-glass Hollywood life of American superstar Anna Scott (Julia Roberts). Despite a conscious effort to play against type in the years following his breakout role in , Grant reunited with screenwriter Richard Curtis after reading the script for , which was too good to turn down. Even now, two and a half decades later, it hasn’t lost any of its unapologetically romantic charm. 3 / 17 14. (1995) 14. (1995) If 1994’s solidified Hugh Grant’s status as a romantic lead, the Jane Austen adaptation , released the following year, showed audiences that he could do it even better in period dress. His Edward Ferrars makes an enchanting first impression, but disappears for a good chunk of the film, reappearing only at the climax to haltingly reveal his true feelings to Emma Thompson’s Elinor Dashwood. That brief scene, and both Grant’s and Thompson’s performance in it, is the perfect capper to a bright and bountiful film full of memorable moments. 4 / 17 13. (1995) 13. (1995) The unhinged length of this film’s title alone should indicate a non-zero level of whimsy without knowing anything else about it. And that’s not too far from the truth. With his star on the rise after hits like and , Grant appeared in the quaint little indie as a cartographer who travels to a Welsh village during World War I to assess whether the local geological feature qualifies as a hill or a mountain. Surrounded by colorful local characters, he does exactly what was expected of him at this point in his career. He’s a bit stiff, a bit flustered, and a bit charming, often all at the same time. 5 / 17 12. (1994) 12. (1994) Unless you lived through it, it’s hard to explain the cultural impact that had on the mid-1990s. It was . And so was Hugh Grant, stumbling through a love confession to Andie MacDowell through the words of David Cassidy (when he was still with The Partridge Family). It was the first of what turned out to be several immensely successful collaborations between Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis that catapulted him from a relatively unknown British actor to a worldwide star. As Charles, his boyish good looks are undercut by his social awkwardness, dry wit, and plenty of self-deprecation. The role would shape his career, for better or worse, for the following decade. 6 / 17 11. (1988) 11. (1988) Before he became a recognizable star, Hugh Grant was making some real offbeat choices in film projects. Take for example, the late ’80s cult classic , in which he plays a British aristocrat whose ancestral Derbyshire home happens to be situated next to a cavern inhabited by an ancient serpentine creature and the immortal priestess who serves it. Directed by Ken Russell and loosely based on a lesser-known Bram Stoker novel, it’s as bonkers as you might expect. As the plucky young hero, Grant doesn’t get to have as much campy fun as the baddies in the one, but based on some of his later performances, he was clearly taking notes. 7 / 17 10. (2002) 10. (2002) Based on the book by Nick Hornby, manages to be heartfelt without ever losing its edge. Grant’s layered performance as Will, an independently wealthy bachelor who forms an unexpected connection with a tragically uncool middle schooler (played by a babyfaced Nicholas Hoult), is a big part of why the film succeeds as well as it does. Will isn’t as romantically idealistic as some other characters Grant has played—he can be duplicitous and manipulative—but his heart’s ultimately in the right place. It feels like just the right balance of sweet and salty for Grant at this stage of his career. 8 / 17 9. (1995) 9. (1995) might be best remembered for a fluke of timing. It came out around the same time Grant was famously arrested for soliciting a sex worker near the Sunset Strip. The proximity of the two events meant that he had to do the press tour for the film while the scandal was unfolding in the tabloids in real-time, leading to an iconic in which Grant defused the situation with his trademark self-effacing humor. That might have been his best performance of the year, though he’s not bad in the film as an increasingly nervous father-to-be. That said, we had to throw in a few extra points towards the unhinged end of the scale just for that extremely floppy hairdo. 9 / 17 8. (2003) 8. (2003) In a film overstuffed with too many characters and intertwining plots, Grant’s storyline as the newly elected Prime Minister who falls for a junior staffer (played by Martine McCutcheon) has always stood out as a fan-favorite in . Chalk it up to another successful team-up with screenwriter Richard Curtis. Grant now talks about how much he dreaded filming the famous scene when his character celebrates his political triumph over the American president (Billy Bob Thornton), but if he didn’t want the image of him dancing through 10 Downing Street to The Pointer Sisters forever burned into our brains, he shouldn’t have done such a good job at it. Afraid it’s too late now, sir. 10 / 17 7. (2007) 7. (2007) Some of the best bits in were the scenes where the film played up the concept of Hugh Grant as a 1980s pop star, both in his heyday and as a washed-up has-been. It’s a fun metatextual angle that directly references Grant’s status as a romantic lead in a late-career rom-com. The big age gap between him and his co-star love interest Drew Barrymore could have been an insurmountable obstacle, but the two actually have a good amount of on-screen chemistry that works in the film’s favor. Perhaps the musical talents he showcased here led to more opportunities to make use of them in films like and . 11 / 17 6. (2001) 6. (2001) According to Hugh Grant, screenwriter Richard Curtis always found it amusing that he was so often cast as such nice, affable blokes when he’s quite the opposite in real life. That public-private contrast clearly factored into his role in as Daniel Cleaver, a modern equivalent of ’s dastardly Mr. Wickham. You can easily see why Bridget (Renée Zellweger) would fall for him, and when his true nature is revealed, it’s devastating. Grant’s performance makes Daniel’s turn from handsome heartthrob to loathsome slimeball seem all too real. 12 / 17 5. (2002) 5. (2002) After Grant made the transition from nice guy to jerk in , he did the reverse as Sandra Bullock’s love interest and boss in . He plays a rich, self-important real estate developer who hires Bullock as his Chief Counsel and becomes so reliant on her for his every need, she gets fed up and quits. It’s during the two weeks after she gives notice that the two of them realize they might actually like each other for real. The movie itself is a fairly standard by-the-numbers rom-com, but Grant and Bullock’s performances elevate it with an acidic chemistry that makes it fun to watch. Two rom-com giants at the top of their game. 13 / 17 4. (1995) 4. (1995) Twenty years before he played drama king Phoenix Buchanan in , Hugh Grant sleazed it up as a predatory theatrical director in , a heavy drama (don’t be fooled by the cheery tone of the trailer) based on the acclaimed novel by Beryl Bainbridge. Grant has played his share of villains over the years, but Meredith Potter might be the most despicable, because of how true to life his sociopathy feels. Reuniting with director Mike Newell, Grant seems desperate to shake off the shackles of typecasting with this film, set in dreary post-World War II Liverpool. Meredith is a monster who callously uses his position of power to prey on boys, girls, or anyone who shows the slightest interest. It’s a supporting role, but he nearly steals the show from co-star Alan Rickman (not an easy thing to do) and a young Georgina Cates. 14 / 17 3. (2016) 3. (2016) In seeking to distance himself from the kinds of romantic roles he played earlier in his career, Grant has perhaps stumbled into another archetype that might suit him even better (and he would probably agree)—the overly theatrical narcissist. His character in is another variation on that theme, and was acclaimed as one of the best performances of his career up to that point. Based on the true story of a wealthy socialite (Meryl Streep, who was nominated for an Oscar in the role) who believed she had talent as an opera singer because no one would dare tell her otherwise, Grant plays Florence’s husband and manager, St. Clair Bayfield. He’s a character with murky motivations, having given up his own acting career to support his untalented wife, and Grant lets you see all the interesting facets within him, even (and especially) the flaws. 15 / 17 2. (2023) 2. (2023) Perhaps all the acclaim Grant received for his campy, over-the-top performance in inspired him to take on another baddie in From the moment we meet slippery rogue Forge Fitzwilliam, his arc from ally to adversary to the grandstanding Lord of Neverwinter is fairly predictable, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t tons of fun to watch Grant chew every bit of scenery within reach. Now that he’s fully in the DGAF phase of his career (just listen to any of his recent interviews), we’d encourage the directors of his future projects to let him off the leash more often. The results are frequently dazzling. 16 / 17 1. (2017) 1. (2017) When filmmaker Paul King first sent the script to Hugh Grant, the character of Phoenix Buchanan, a “washed-up narcissistic old actor” (in Grant’s words), was called Hugh. Grant could have chosen to take that personally and refused to have anything to do with the project, but instead, he embraced it. The performance he gives in the film is one of his best and one of his most unhinged. In a quest to hunt down a hidden treasure using clues from a pop-up book in Paddington’s possession, he employs a series of eccentric disguises to trick the poor, innocent bear. If Grant didn’t have a blast making the film, he did a fine job of making it look as though he did. 17 / 17",

        "content": "Reacher Season 2: Is Willa Fitzgerald’s Roscoe in the New Season? By has just dropped and fans are curious about whether or not from the first season will be in the new season. Here is all you need to know. Is Willa Fitzgerald’s Roscoe in Reacher Season 2? The reason for Roscoe’s absence in the second season is that Jack Reacher has moved out of Margrave, Roscoe’s hometown. Additionally, due to Reacher staying faithful to the books and closely following the story laid out by it, Roscoe’s absence is a given, evidenced by how she is not in the books after Killing Floor, the book adapted by the first season of the show. Why isn’t Roscoe in Season 2? Moreover, Reacher and Roscoe, who developed romantic feelings for each other, parted ways after realizing their relationship would not work due to Reacher’s status as a drifter who is constantly on the move and Roscoe’s dedication to staying in Margrave and making it a better place. However, as seen at the end of the first season, Reacher and Roscoe parted ways on good terms, with the Reacher suggesting Roscoe run for mayor and Roscoe giving Reacher her number and telling him to call her anytime he felt like doing so. Roscoe’s absence and exit from the series after the first season was not a shock to the actress behind her, Willa Fitzgerald, who revealed in an interview with that she was always aware that her character would only have a story arc for one season.

        "content": "As of this post, it’s nearly 8 a.m. ET, and and Ty Dolla Sign their collaborative album , which was expected to drop at midnight ET. Given West’s history of album delays and working on projects until the last possible second, this isn’t particularly surprising. This isn’t even the first time has faced a delay, as . As for why the album isn’t out yet, it looks like West was trying to cross some T’s and dot some I’s before the final buzzer. At 10:23 p.m. ET last night (December 14), 97 minutes before the album was presumably set for a midnight release, West tweeted a screenshot of a text he supposedly sent to Nicki Minaj, which read, “Hi it’s ye. May I call you about clearing new body on the new album.” . — ye (@kanyewest) , Minaj gave Kanye’s request a public “no.” During an Instagram Live broadcast last night, she said, “Child, that train has left the station, OK? No disrespect in any way. I just put out a brand new album. Now why would I put out a song that has been out for three years? Come on, guys. You know?” Nicki Minaj says she will NOT be clearing her verse to Kanye West’s “New Body” for his new album. – “That train has left the station.” — She’s Fishy ➐ (@ShesFishy) , Minaj said of “New Body,” a demo of which leaked back in 2018, “The public adored ‘New Body.’ ‘New Body’ is the biggest hit record that never came out. So what I thought was interesting was that Kanye made me write my ‘New Body’ verse four times over in order to fit into where he was creatively and spiritually in his life. […] I missed it by a year, I guess. Had ‘New Body’ been out when he was not in his gospel era, then it would’ve seen the light of day. But, it didn’t, so it wasn’t meant to be. Everybody knows that’s the hit that got away. […] I think the ship has sailed for ‘New Body,’ everybody has come to love the original way they heard it.” All that said, it is still December 15 right now, so West and Ty still have well over half a day to get everything in order and release before the weekend if that’s something they’re committed to doing.",

        "description": "\"It is literally like losing a member of your family.\" — Peter Bergman",
        "content": "Playing Jack Abbott — the patriarch of the Abbotts, the first family of “The Young and the Restless” — for 34 years, Peter Bergman has grown to have a second set of kin. “Those people get a very special place in my heart,” Bergman, who is up for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for the 24th time at the 50th Daytime Emmy Awards on Friday — which will broadcast on CBS and stream on Paramount+ live at 9 p.m. ET. So the three-time Daytime Emmy winner took it hard, right along with the rest of the “Y&R” cast, when Billy Miller — who played Jack Abbott’s younger half-brother, Billy Abbott, from 2008 to 2014, died by suicide at 43 in September after years of battling bipolar depression . “It is absolutely heartbreaking,” Bergman, 70, told The Post. “It is literally like losing a member of your family. In fact, the “Y&R” cast planned to remember Miller at their holiday party on Thursday, the day before the Daytime Emmys , in Los Angeles. “We still care about it. We’re still talking about it.” Miller was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and also starred on “General Hospital” as Jason Morgan and Drew Cain from 2014 to 2019. After his 592-episode run on the ABC daytime soap opera, Miller appeared on “Suits,” “Truth Be Told” and “NCIS.” After playing Dr. Cliff Warner on “All My Children” for 10 years, Bergman has now been at “The Young and the Restless” since 1989. But because of his sense of family at “AMC,” it was a tricky transition for him. “My job at ‘All My Children’ ended before I was ready,” said Bergman, whose supercouple romance with Taylor Miller’s Nina had ended. “They kind of decided, ‘If Nina is not going to be here, why do we need Cliff?’ So they decided to let me go. “It was heartbreaking,” he continued. “That was my first daytime family, and I was so invested in it all. And I got this job on ‘Young and the Restless,’ but my heart was still in Pine Valley [with [‘AMC’].” But after the first of his 24 Daytime Emmy nominations was for “All My Children,” Bergman went on to amass 23 more at “The Young & the Restless.” Now he is the big daddy of Y&R” — the highest-rated of the three soap operas remaining on network TV (along with “The Bold and the Beautiful” and “General Hospital” ) — which celebrated its 50th anniversary in March. “I have a kind of deep responsibility for my family members on the show,” he said. “The same way Jack does.”",

        "content": "LONDON—The dollar headed for its biggest weekly drop in five months on Friday as the prospect of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve against a tough line from central banks in Europe on monetary policy fed weekly gains in the euro and the pound. The Bank of Japan is the last of the major central banks to meet this month and the question among traders and investors is whether or not the BOJ will signal its intention to ditch its policy of keeping interest rates at rock-bottom next week. In an action-packed week for central banks, traders found more clarity on when interest rate cuts were likely after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at Wednesday's meeting that the tightening of monetary policy is likely over, with a discussion of cuts coming \"into view.\" The divergence between the U.S. and other central banks has set the dollar index on track for a near-2 percent slide this week—its largest weekly loss since mid-July—and around its lowest in four months. It was last flat on the day at 101.94. Futures markets show investors are now pricing in a 75 percent chance of a rate cut in March by the Fed, according to the CME FedWatch tool. At the start of December, there was around a 40 percent chance of a cut. Markets expect U.S. rates to fall by 150 basis points by the end of next year, double the Fed's projections that implied 75 basis points of cuts in 2024. Oil Prices on Track for First Weekly Rise in 2 Months Shares and Bonds Keep On Climbing as Fed Pivot Rally Rolls On The prospect of such a benign rate environment has ignited a rally across risk assets over the past 24 hours, at the expense of the dollar. But the mood may not last, as the U.S. economy is slowing, while inflation is still above target, analysts said. \"There was an element of surprise—the extent to which the Fed has gone with giving the market what it wants. Christmas came early,\" City Index strategist Fiona Cincotta said. Financial markets are pricing in a steep drop in rates, but not the economic pain that might come from the kind of slowdown in activity that it may take to bring core inflation back to the Fed's 2 percent target. Investors are nonetheless still betting heavily on rate cuts from both central banks next year. The ECB has more scope than most to ease, according to Pepperstone strategist Chris Weston, given low growth and a rapid decline in inflation. \"However, the pushback from (ECB President) Lagarde and co suggests conjecture on the timing of initial easing—perhaps this is a function that its desirable to keep one's currency strong to limit imported inflation.\" Preliminary readings of business activity in France and Germany on Friday showed an unexpected slowdown in the eurozone's two largest economies this month, which sent the euro down by as much as 0.4 percent to a session low of $1.0946. It was last at $1.0954, still up 2 percent this week. Sterling eased 0.2 percent to $1.2745, having surged 1.1 percent to a four-month high of $1.2793 on Thursday after the BoE's hawkish tilt. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen strengthened 0.1 percent to 141.70 per dollar, having risen 0.7 percent to a four-and-a-half month high of 140.95 on Thursday. The yen is up 2 percent this week, set for a fifth straight week of gains against the dollar, its longest such stretch since mid-2020.",

        "content": "You don’t read a book like former Wyoming U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney’s tell-all looking for literary pearls. You read it to find out what was going on behind the scenes in Congress after the 2020 election, as Donald Trump’s Republican sycophants and enablers schemed with him to overturn the results of a legitimate U.S. election. You read it to remember just how feckless Trump was when he was in power, and to remind yourself exactly what he is capable of should the nightmare of a second Trump term come to pass. Oh, and of course you read it because who could ever tire of revelations about former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s spinelessness and treachery? God, what a snake. No, strike that. Snakes actually have spines. After forcefully blaming Trump for Jan. 6, McCarthy went to Mar-a-Lago to suck up to the former president, Cheney writes in “Oath and Honor,” because he needed money. Nearly every major corporate donor had threatened to withdraw support from Republicans who voted to object to the electoral college votes. Because McCarthy’s only real political skill was fundraising, she says, he was desperate for access to Trump’s extensive lists of small-dollar donors. “In order to use those lists,” she writes, “Kevin would have to help Donald Trump cover up the stain of his assault on our democracy.” Like many who lean left politically, I have no enduring affection for the Cheney family. They oppose almost everything I support: reproductive rights, renewable energy, the Affordable Care Act, immigration reform, you name it. I was appalled by then-Vice President Dick Cheney’s warmongering and manipulation of then-President George W. Bush. And I’ve never forgotten, either, that the 2012 wedding of her gay sister, Mary. She , but her absence was downright cruel. Imagine my surprise, then, when a tear actually sprang to my eye for a moment after reading about a particularly charged moment between Liz and her father on New Year’s Day 2021. On Dec. 26, 2020, the Washington Post’s David Ignatius with a dire warning about Trump’s postelection plotting. Shortly after he lost, Trump had fired senior Defense Department officials and installed loyalists in their place, an unprecedented move by a lame-duck president. Was he stacking the military deck in order to invoke the Insurrection Act and stay in office? A delegation of senior Republicans, wrote Ignatius, should pay a visit to Trump and tell him in no uncertain terms that he’d lost. There were two problems, however, as Cheney writes. First, not enough senior Republican officials would be willing to risk Trump’s wrath, and second, it was clear that privately urging Trump to do anything against his self-interest would be futile. Father and daughter came up with a plan: Dick Cheney was a former Defense secretary, so together they would reach out to the nine other living former secretaries of Defense and ask them to sign a public letter urging a peaceful transition of power. “Efforts to involve the U.S. armed forces in solving election disputes,” , “would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory.” As Liz Cheney prepared to return to Washington from Wyoming in January 2021, her father gave her a hug, and then, she wrote, “He looked at me and with steel in his voice, said, ‘Defend the republic, daughter.’ “ “I will, Dad,” she replied. “Always.” Unlike many of Cheney’s critics, I see nothing self-important or self-serving here. Liz Cheney is one of the few heroic, high-profile Republicans who were willing to do the right thing after the 2020 election, even if it meant sacrificing her job and her political prospects. Surprisingly, her book is not all grim. Early in Cheney’s first House term, she writes, the loathsome Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio asked her to become a member of his ultra-right-wing Freedom Caucus. His pitch? “We don’t have any women and we need one.” “Tempting as this offer was,” she dryly notes, “I took a pass.” Her recollection of the debate among her colleagues about whether to kick her out of her leadership position for voting to impeach Trump is priceless. Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York wanted Cheney’s head because Stefanik’s constituents were writing letters to their local papers asking why their representative had not taken the same “principled” stand against Trump that Cheney had. (“Many of us who had known Elise since before she abandoned all principle were curious about how she had lost her sense of right and wrong,” Cheney writes.) A number of her House male colleagues simply did not appreciate Cheney’s . “Ralph Normal of South Carolina kept repeating that his problem with me was my attitude: ‘You’ve just got such a defiant attitude!’ ” (So unladylike!) Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania was hurt by Cheney’s early statement in favor of Trump’s impeachment. “It’s like playing in the biggest game of your life,” he whined, “and you see your girlfriend sitting on the opponent’s side.” Female members loudly objected. “Yeah,” Cheney said. “I’m not your girlfriend.” Related Articles On Jan. 6, 2022, one year after the attack by deeply misguided Trump supporters — for their crimes that day — there was a small ceremony and a moment of silence on the House floor. Only two Republicans showed up: Liz Cheney and her father. The following month, Cheney and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, the two Republicans who served on the House Jan. 6 committee, were by the Republican National Committee for “participating in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse.” Cheney, as always, was unbowed. “I do not recognize those in my party who have abandoned the Constitution to embrace Donald Trump,” she responded at the time. “History will be their judge.” In her book, she reflects on the moment: “The resolution reflected a political party that had lost its principles and, frankly, seemed to be led by morons.” Sadly, it still is.",

        "content": "Over the last few years, I’ve been working on improving a portable emergency kit. The basic concept I follow is similar to what DHS recommends , with several days worth of food and water, plus some other odds and ends. I have a backpack for each member of the family, with extra supplies for everyone stored in adults and teenagers bags, and less in children’s bags. Everyone has some food and water, but people able to carry more have tarps, tiny tents, and supplies to share with smaller kids. Some readers may be unfamiliar with why a family should do this, so I’ll briefly explain it. In the event of a major disaster, it’s anticipated that an overwhelmed local and state government might not get sufficient amounts of federal aid to help everyone for around three days. Bungled responses like Hurricane Katrina show us that people could need basic emergency supplies for even longer if a government gets caught flat-footed enough. One thing I do in my bag is try to carry along some extra communications supplies. We probably wouldn’t need it for our family alone, but I want to be able to help other people in the event of a major disaster, too. If communications aren’t available for hundreds of miles, people could get a great sense of relief being able to let family members know that they’re OK. Or, in the worst case, it may be necessary to communicate with people hundreds of miles away just to get much-needed help. Here’s what my setup looked like to be able to do that in 2020: I had a 60-watt solar panel that folds up, a small charge controller, a small LiFePo4 battery, and would use all this to power a small laptop, a Yaesu FT-818 HF radio, and some gear to translate analog to digital. I also have a small handheld radio to put in the bag for local communications. The purpose of the HF radio is to be able to send signals over the horizon. Normally, VHF and UHF radio signals run into vegetation or mountains while stronger signals that don’t run into the earth tend to just go off into space. Anyone beyond line of sight can’t hear your signal because it simply can’t reach them. Mountaintop radio repeaters can help you extend your reach, but a major disaster might knock those out or they could end up being really crowded. But, there’s a special range of frequencies (generally between 2-30 MHz, aka High Frequency, “HF”, or “shortwave”) that can get around all of these problems with one weird trick: bouncing off the ionosphere. My little portable Yaesu radio is capable of transmitting and receiving on those frequencies. Using carefully processed digital modes, like JS8 , I can communicate around the world with as little as 1-3 watts of power. But, all of that equipment was pretty heavy still. The panel was pretty thick folded up. The battery was heavy. But, the rest of the gear wasn’t that bad. So, I’ve been experimenting with finding lighter gear over the last three years. The smallest power station I’ve come up with so far is the Gooloo GTX 280. It’s got 280 watt-hours of storage, and it has an inverter you can plug into it to power other things. It’s not very strong in output, but it’s got more than enough power for my laptop, radio, and other gear. Overall, it saved a lot of weight compared to a Jackery Explorer 300 I was trying to squeeze into the bag. Next, I needed to get the solar panel down in size and weight. 60 watts proved to be a lot more than I really needed, and the big, canvas sided cheap panel I bought from Amazon in 2020 was just too darned heavy and bulky. But, I decided to give Jackery’s smallest offering a try. I’m not doing a review of the panel here, but it suffices to say that it’s far smaller and lighter than my 60 watt panel while still producing around 35-40 watts of power. I only need 10-20 watts, so this works well for my needs. It works with any of the company’s Explorer 300 power stations, but I’ll likely use it with the Gooloo because it’s smaller and lighter. Folded up, the whole setup is a lot smaller, with the panel taking up less space than my emergency rations box. This allowed me to put the whole setup in a smaller bag that puts a lot less strain on my back. For people curious about what’s in the cardboard box, here’s a peek: To save weight and space, I use the little 3600-calorie emergency rations with a 5-year shelf life. They taste like graham crackers, and break into 400-calorie pieces. I have about 6 days worth of these rations in my bag. Add some water bottles, some toiletries, and a few other odds and ends, like a water filtration system, and I’m set up to suffer a lot less than someone who walks into the desert with just the clothes on their back. Eventually, I want to replace the cardboard box with something a little smaller, but for now it does the job of making it easy to remove the rations for times I just want to go play with the radio gear on hikes. I’m still working on ways to get this whole setup lighter and more power efficient. One thing I’m working on is replacing the whole laptop with a Raspberry Pi computer that my folding phone can connect to. This will save a ton of weight all by itself, while using less power. It can also make for easier on-the-go radio operating at some point. Next, I want to replace handheld radios we carry in our bags with Meshtastic networking nodes . These use a lot less power and can provide secure text messaging on unlicensed radio frequencies. I’m the only licenses amateur radio operator in the family, and getting people to get a license is like pulling teeth. So, coming up with a better solution that works with existing things like phones can really make a difference. So, there’s still plenty of work to be done improving the setup further!

        "content": "LONDON—Oil prices rose on Friday, on track to notch their first weekly rise in two months after benefiting from a bullish forecast from the International Energy Agency (IEA) on oil demand for next year and a weaker dollar. Brent futures rose 21 cents to $76.82 a barrel at 0918 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude also climbed 21 cents, to $71.79. Both benchmarks were on course for a modest weekly gain, having been lifted by a mid-week announcement from the U.S. Federal Reserve that it could cut borrowing costs next year. The dollar fell to a four-month low on Thursday after the U.S. central bank indicated interest rate hikes have likely ended and lower borrowing costs are coming in 2024. The dollar index was broadly steady on Friday. A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated oil cheaper for foreign purchasers. World oil consumption will rise by 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, the IEA said in a monthly report, up 130,000 bpd from its previous forecast, citing an improvement in the outlook for U.S. demand and lower oil prices. US Retail Investors Sold Stocks at Fastest Pace Since 2021 Despite Market Rally: S&P Global Stock Market Today: Wall Street Rises Again as the Dow Ticks to Another Record The 2024 estimate is less than half of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) demand growth forecast of 2.25 million bpd. \"OPEC+ production cuts are likely to keep the oil market in balance at the start of 2024 despite weaker demand, which should allay current oversupply concerns,\" Commerzbank said. OPEC+, which groups OPEC and allies led by Russia, in late November agreed voluntary cuts of about 2.2 million bpd lasting throughout the first quarter. Weak economic data from Germany, Europe's biggest economy, and China, the world's biggest oil importer, weighed on prices, however. The HCOB German Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), compiled by S&P Global, fell for the sixth consecutive month, declining to 46.7 in December from November's 47.8, below the 48.2 forecast by economists. Data released by China's statistics bureau on Friday showed refinery runs in November dropped to their lowest level since the start of 2023, as margin pressure on non-state owned refiners saw them cut back production, while sluggish diesel consumption weighed on national fuel demand. Despite ongoing woes in China's property market, the data also showed a better-than-expected performance in industrial output and improving retail sales, lending some relief to market sentiment amid the country's anaemic post-COVID economic recovery.",

        "content": "An Atlanta woman pleaded guilty to stealing more than $4 million from Facebook while she was an executive at the company. Barbara Furlow-Smiles who worked as a lead strategist, global head of employee resource groups and diversity engagement at Facebook, Inc., now known as Meta, from about January 2017 to September 2021 according to U.S. Attorney Northern District of Georgia Ryan K. Buchanan’s Office. “This defendant abused a position of trust as a global diversity executive for Facebook to defraud the company of millions of dollars, ignoring the insidious consequences of undermining the importance of her DEI mission,” said Buchanan in a statement. According to the US Attorney, Furlow-Smiles used her Facebook expense account to live a luxurious lifestyle in California and Georgia. Furlow-Smiles fraudulently used Facebook funds to pay for numerous personal expenses including hair stylists, babysitters, and $18,000 to a preschool for tuition, according to Buchanan. Furlow-Smiles’ “scheme” was to link her company credit cards to PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App, then use those cards to pay others for services never performed, Buchanan says. Related Articles Friends, relatives, and associates who received the payments would then return some of the money to Furlow-Smiles as a kickback, according to Buchanan’s Office. Investigators say Furlow-Smiles would create inflated invoices to pay them, then those vendors would return a portion of the payment to Furlow-Smiles. Buchanan adds, “She even involved relatives, friends, and other associates in her crimes, all to fund a lavish lifestyle through fraud rather than hard and honest work.” Sentencing for Barbara Furlow-Smiles is scheduled for March 19, 2024.

        "description": "The child's attorney said he doesn't believe a White child would have been arrested under similar circumstances.",
        "content": "A 10-year-old Black child who urinated in a parking lot must serve three months’ probation and write a two-page book report on the late NBA star Kobe Bryant, a Mississippi judge has ordered. Tate County Youth Court Judge Rusty Harlow handed down the sentence Tuesday after the child's lawyer reached an agreement with a special prosecutor. The prosecution threatened to upgrade the charge of “child in need of supervision” to a more serious charge of disorderly conduct if the boy's family took the case to trial, said Carlos Moore, the child’s attorney. “I thought any sensible judge would dismiss the charge completely. It’s just asinine,\" Moore said. \"There were failures in the criminal justice system all the way around.” Moore said he doesn’t believe a White child would have been arrested under similar circumstances, and he couldn't find a similar instance of a child receiving a similar sentence for the same offense. “I don’t think there is a male in America who has not discreetly urinated in public,” Moore said. The child’s mother has said her son urinated behind her vehicle while she was visiting a lawyer’s office in Senatobia, Mississippi, on Aug. 10. Police officers in the town of about 8,100 residents, 40 miles south of Memphis, Tennessee, saw the child urinating and arrested him. Officers put him in a squad car and took him to the police station. Senatobia Police Chief Richard Chandler said the child was not handcuffed, but his mother said he was put in a jail cell, according to . Days after the episode, Chandler said the officers violated their training on how to deal with children. He said one of the officers who took part in the arrest was “no longer employed,” and other officers would be disciplined. He didn’t specify whether the former officer was fired or quit, or what type of discipline the others would face. Chandler did not immediately respond to a voicemail message Thursday. Reached by phone, a staffer for Paige Williams, the Tate County Youth Court prosecutor appointed to handle the case, said the attorney could not comment on cases involving juveniles. Rashad Robinson, president of the civil rights organization Color Of Change, said the decision to charge the child didn’t make sense. “Nothing about this case from the decisions by the police, the prosecutor, and the judge makes us safer or is a good use of taxpayer resources,\" Robinson said in a statement. He said there is a “long and unforgivable history in Mississippi and across the country” of a “two-tiered justice system” that offers one path for Black children and another for White. It was initially unclear whether prosecutors would take up the case. Moore requested a dismissal, but prosecutors declined. He planned on going to trial but shifted strategy after prosecutors threatened to upgrade the charges. The child's family chose to accept the probation sentence because it would not appear on the boy's criminal record. The 10-year-old is required to check in with a probation officer once per month. Williams initially wanted the child to write a report on public decency, but the judge changed the subject to Bryant because the boy is a basketball fan, Moore said. Marie Ndiaye, deputy director of the Justice Project at the Advancement Project, a racial justice organization, said the arrest is emblematic of broader issues in the criminal justice system. “Sentencing anyone, let alone a young child, to probation under these facts is sure to add to the trauma and denigration this child has suffered since their arrest,” Ndiaye said. “This is all the more proof that we need to severely limit police interactions with civilians, from petty retail theft to traffic stops and even so-called ‘quality of life’ offenses. For Black people in America, it is a matter of life and death.”",

        "content": "Buffalo and Western New York are known for several things, from football and hockey to its amazing architecture; the Queen City is a great place to live, work, and play. One of the things that we do especially well in the 716 is art and history. Folks may not realize it, but Buffalo has some world-class art right here in Western New York. From art museums like Buffalo AKG Art Museum and Burchfield Penney Art Center to the Buffalo History Museum to all of the public art displays that sprinkle the city, there are tons of great things for you to see and take selfies in front of. One great spot in the area to do just that is down at Canalside in downtown Buffalo. Just steps from the Buffalo River and Lake Erie, you can find all sorts of exciting things to check out. Some of these include sculptures like Shark Girl, the Silent Poets, and statues honoring famous Buffalo sports players like Tim Horton and The French Connection. Thanks to a partnership between the Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation (ECHDC), Empire State Development, and Visit Buffalo Niagara (VBN), a for us all to enjoy. In a big ceremony last week, officials ECHDC, VBN, and ESD unveiled a new permanent sculpture on Marine Drive, near the intersection with Hanover Street. That new sculpture is called BUF and features three steel 3-D letters—the sculpture stands 5 feet tall, with each letter weighing more than 1,000 pounds. This new sculpture was designed and fabricated by and painted by Buffalo's Nicole Cherry. Buffalonians are proud of their city, so we expect the BUF sculpture at Canalside to quickly become a popular selfie site... We have seen how prominent pieces of public art enhance the millions of dollars Governor Hochul has invested in the waterfront. I encourage families to take their holiday pictures by the new sculpture then head to the ice to say hello to Shark Girl and enjoy some time skating, riding the ice bikes, sipping hot chocolate, and taking in the holiday lights. -Joan Kesner, Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation Board Chairperson.

And I would disagree to a degree with the person who posed that question. I think the Bloodline storyline, which started long before Vince left and was getting very exciting long before Vince left, Vince was very much a part of that storyline. And perhaps in some ways, at some points, he held it back. Maybe it could have gotten bigger, faster, stronger sooner. But Vince was very, very much a part of that. Vince’s [McMahon] commitment to Roman Reigns; let’s go back now three, four, five years. Vince was determined to get Roman Reigns over. So people could say, ‘Oh yeah, as soon as Vince left, everything got better.’ It’s not a very realistic perspective. “Yeah, I think things have gotten better better since Vince left. Only because I think the creative process is now much more efficient. I think your writing team can now, with confidence, start laying out stories without knowing in the back of their mind, in the front of the mind that there’s about a 75% chance, even though Vince would say, ‘Yeah, that looks good’ on Friday on the plane, going to Raw on Monday morning he might just tear the whole thing up and start over again. That’s a very, very uneasy feeling if you’re a creative person. And then you get to the building and you’re going to know that you’re going to have two hours to write a brand new show from top to bottom that has to be approved. Not only does it have to be approved, if there is a spelling error in the first draft of what you think you want to do and you want to present to Vince with only two hours before show time. But if he sees a typo or poor grammar, there’s a chance he’ll just rip the whole thing up without the rest of it, and ask you to go redo it. And let you know what he thinks of your grammar and your spelling on your way out the door. That’s not efficient creative. And it takes a creative person so outside of their game and the train of thought, the frame of mind, the vibe they have to be in, it’s just it’s a different world being in creative. And to have that kind of instability throughout the entire process doesn’t get you to the best creativity by any stretch of the imagination.” On whether WWE trusts Punk enough to make him World Champion: “You know, I don’t know the culture that exists today. I knew the culture that existed last time I was there. I was in — and I’m going to be very vague, but I’m doing it intentionally out of respect, so please accept that. But I was in a meeting, Punk’s name came up, and all of the key decision-makers in WWE at that time were in that meeting. And that name came up, and the conversation lasted all of three minutes. And that was the end of that. That was the culture then. I don’t know what the culture is now. You know, Triple H used to work for me, Paul Levesque worked for WCW before he went to WWE but I never got to know Paul then, a couple of conversations with him really. Even when I worked with him when I first went to WWE as a talent, very little conversation with Paul Levesque. When I worked there in 2019 for a cup of coffee, I interfaced with Paul Levesque more than I ever had in the previous 20 years. But even then, I didn’t really get to know him. So I don’t know what Paul thinks, and what his tolerance is for situations like CM Punk brings. “I suspect that — two things. One is, I don’t think CM Punk’s going to even try to exert the kind of — I’m going to call it bullying, right? He ain’t throwing his weight around backstage at WWE anywhere. The company is so much bigger than him, there’s no room for that there, and nobody will tolerate it. And I think because of history, people will be watching very carefully how Phil Brooks as an individual handles himself professionally behind — because there’s no question the CM Punk character is viable and valuable. The question mark is, is Phil Brooks the professional that he needs to be to make it work? I suspect he probably is. I suspect that, I hope, that Phil Brooks is going, ‘Wow, this is a hell of an opportunity. I can write the end of my own story. I can retire from this business on a positive note. And oh by the way, I can pocket millions and millions of dollars along the way. But I gotta be a team player.’ That’s what I hope, and that’s what I think is probably going on: he’s a smart guy. He has to be a smart guy to get where he is right now. But I do think that there’s probably eyes on Phil Brooks and the way he conducts himself. But I don’t know where the guardrails are, but I don’t think it’s going to be an issue, I really don’t. I said this before he even went there when speculation was, ‘Do you think he’ll go?’ I said, ‘Sure, he’ll go. If he has the opportunity, he’d be crazy not to.’ But he’s not going to get away — there is no CM Punk running amok backstage. No one’s going to get choked out. No one’s going to be in fear for their life. You’re not going to have the craziness and the mishegoss going on backstage and the drama that went on in AEW because it’s an entirely different environment.” If you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit 83 Weeks with an h/t to 411mania.com for the transcription.",

        "content": "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) knew that America’s meat industry had a drug problem. For decades, evidence had amassed that the widespread use of antibiotics to make livestock grow faster — and survive the crowded, unsanitary conditions of factory farms — was causing bacteria to mutate and develop resistance to antibiotics used in human medicine. Over time, once easily treatable human infections, such as urinary tract infections and tuberculosis, became to treat. A foundational component of modern medicine was starting to crumble. But it wasn’t until the mid-2010s that the FDA finally took the basic steps of requiring farmers to get veterinary prescriptions for antibiotics and banning the use of antibiotics to make animals grow faster — steps that some European regulators had taken a decade or more prior. Thanks to those two actions alone, sales of medically important antibiotics for livestock plummeted 42 percent from 2015 to 2017. But in a concerning course reversal, antibiotic sales for use in livestock have ticked back up, increasing 12 percent from 2017 to 2022, per a new . Sales increased 4 percent in 2022 alone. In 2022, the chicken industry’s antibiotics purchasing slightly declined, but in every other major sector — cattle, pork, and turkey — antibiotic sales rose. “Antibiotic sales to meat producers continue to increase despite efforts that the FDA has made,” Louis Sokolow, a policy associate with Frontier Group, a public health and sustainability research organization, told Vox. “The status quo of these small increases year over year is not enough to protect people from antibiotic-resistant bacteria.” According to an published in September by the Natural Resources Defense Council and One Health Trust, medically important antibiotics are increasingly going to livestock instead of humans. In 2017, the meat industry purchased 62 percent of the US supply. By 2020, it rose to 69 percent. It’s a sobering turn of events with life-and-death implications. In 2019, antibiotic-resistant bacteria directly killed over globally, including , and more than 5 million others across the world died from diseases where antibiotic resistance played a role — far more than the global toll of HIV/AIDS or malaria, leading the World Health Organization to antibiotic resistance “one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today.” Public health advocates want to see the FDA take the threat much more seriously, and often point to Europe as a . From 2011 to 2022, antibiotic sales for use in livestock fell across the European Union, and use per animal is now that of the US. Last year, the EU implemented perhaps its most significant reform yet: banning the routine use of antibiotics to prevent disease, reserving their use for only when animals are actually sick. It’s unlikely the FDA will follow in Europe’s footsteps any time soon. Asked about an EU-style ban on preventive use of antibiotics, an FDA spokesperson responded, “The laws in the US and our livestock population are not the same as that of the EU or other countries. The FDA’s initiatives to promote judicious use and reduce AMR [antimicrobial resistance] were devised specifically for the US and the conditions we face with the aim of maximizing effectiveness and cooperation of drug sponsors, veterinarians, and animal producers.” The FDA and the US food industry have proven that they can make progress on the issue — but to keep antibiotics working, they need to do a lot more. That will require them to tackle beef and pork, two of the more stubborn and complex sectors of America’s meat system that just can’t seem to quit antibiotics, since doing so could demand substantive changes to how animals are farmed for food. The American antibiotic-free revolution that wasn’t It wasn’t just the FDA’s new rules that caused antibiotic sales for livestock to plunge in a two-year period — Big Chicken played a part too. In the early 2000s, the nation’s fourth-largest chicken producer began efforts to wean its birds off antibiotics, which it achieved in 2016 by changing chickens’ diets and replacing antibiotics with vaccines and probiotics. At first, chicken raised without antibiotics cost 50 percent more, but the company says it has since been able to all but close the cost differential. In the mid-2010s, while Perdue was making progress, activists leveraged the momentum and McDonald’s to source chicken raised without medically important antibiotics which contributed to a domino effect in which producers and restaurants made further pledges to reduce antibiotics in poultry. By 2020, a little of America’s 9 billion chickens farmed for meat were raised without antibiotics, according to an . The sea change in chicken production demonstrated it was possible to quickly scale down antibiotics in farming, but it didn’t do much to reduce overall use, as the chicken industry only used 6 percent of antibiotics in agriculture in 2016. And the momentum didn’t spread to other parts of the meat business, like beef and pork, which together account for over of medically important antibiotics fed to farmed animals. Some of the lack of progress in beef and pork comes down to the simple fact that pigs and cattle are raised differently than chickens. Chickens are slaughtered at just six or seven weeks old, so the chance they’ll get sick is lower than pigs, who are slaughtered at six months old, or cattle, slaughtered at around three years of age. The chicken industry is also vertically integrated, meaning a company like Tyson or Perdue controls virtually every link in the supply chain, so making big changes like cutting out antibiotics is easier than in the more decentralized supply chain of beef. For example, the typical steer will change hands several times before slaughter, going from a breeder to pasture grazing to a feedlot, all of which make it harder to coordinate an antibiotic-free regimen. In the last few months of their life cattle are also fed a high-grain diet that they aren’t adapted to digest, which increases the chance they’ll develop a , a condition that’s prevented with antibiotics. The pork sector, like poultry, is also vertically integrated, but the industry has largely opposed , , and reforms. Antibiotics in pig production shot up from 2017 to 2022. There’s also no pork or beef giant that’s taken the antibiotic-free leap like Perdue did for chicken. That could change in the years ahead: McDonald’s, the world’s largest beef purchaser, at the end of 2022 that it plans to reduce antibiotic use in its beef supply chain. However, the announcement didn’t come with a timeline, which . Although voluntary change can move the needle, without regulation, industry has little incentive to make the dramatic reductions needed to safeguard antibiotics. While the FDA has prohibited meat producers from using antibiotics to speed up growth— their in agriculture — some of the that , like tylosin, are still allowed for disease prevention. Matthew Wellington, formerly of the Public Interest Research Group, or PIRG, told Vox this is a that disincentivizes producers from reducing antibiotics: “Our concern has always been that they’re just putting a different name on the same kind of use, which is a problem.” (This story was originally published in January 2023; Wellington has since left PIRG). In response to this concern, an FDA spokesperson said, “Veterinarians are on the front lines and as prescribers, they’re in the best position to ensure that both medically important and non-medically important antimicrobials are being used appropriately.” Aside from outright banning the routine use of medically important antibiotics to prevent disease, PIRG would like to see the FDA take three actions: set a target of reducing antibiotic use by 50 percent by the end of 2025 (based on 2010 levels); publish data on antibiotic use, not just sales; and limit the duration of antibiotic courses for farmed animals. An FDA spokesperson said specific reduction targets weren’t possible because the agency doesn’t know how many antibiotics farmers are using: “We cannot effectively monitor antimicrobial use without first putting a system in place for determining [a] baseline and assessing trends over time.” The agency right now only collects sales data, and it’s been exploring a to collect and report real-world use data. Some states haven’t waited on federal regulators: have both restricted the use of antibiotics on farms. How the Europeans — and some Americans — are quitting antibiotics on the farm Just because it’s difficult to reduce antibiotics in beef and pork production doesn’t mean it’s impossible, as the story of Iowa pig farmers Tim and Deleana Roseland demonstrates. In 2005, they switched from raising pigs in the conventional manner — tightly cramped and fed a steady diet of antibiotics — to raising pigs for Niman Ranch, a higher-welfare meat company now owned by Perdue. That required the Roselands to ditch the routine use of antibiotics. “I was nervous about it at first but as it turned out, it was no big deal whatsoever,” Tim Roseland said. But he added that it wouldn’t have been possible with his old setup: “There’s too much overcrowding, small pens, too many pigs crammed into a little area.” Their newer system gives each pig more space in larger pens, and bedding that they root through and chew on, instead of, when they’re packed into factory farms, chewing on each other. They also give the pigs more vaccines and feed them probiotics. And there’s a lot to learn from Denmark, Europe’s pork producer. From 1992 to 2008, antibiotic use per pig fell by over 50 percent, and while pig mortality went up in the short term, by 2008 it had dropped back to near-1992 levels. The small country’s transformation wasn’t a matter of rocket science, but a suite of smart : more frequent barn cleaning, better ventilation, later piglet weaning, more space per pig, , and experimenting with feed and additives. All this comes with difficult tradeoffs: antibiotic-free pork costs more and requires more land, which increases its carbon footprint. But we can’t expect to have cheap meat forever without a cost to public health, an uncomfortable truth that’s led many environmental and public health groups to champion a message of meat. “I think the fact that Denmark, despite very low antibiotic use since 1995, is still one of the biggest pork exporters in the world, already speaks for itself,” said Francesca Chiara, a director at the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. Given the of global antibiotic sales for agriculture, Denmark’s example may not be speaking loudly enough. But it’s time we listen — nothing less than the future of human medicine is at stake.",

        "content": "Growing up in western North Dakota, Angelo Vournas developed a passion for archery hunting in the Badlands at an early age. “My mom would call into school at noon and say I was sick, so I’d go down to the Badlands my senior year,” said Vournas, who graduated from high school in Williston, attended college at UND and now lives in Minot. “I spent a lot of time down there.” Then as now, the vast amount of public land available in the Badlands of western North Dakota and the potential for shooting a trophy mule deer buck with his bow were big attractions, Vournas says.

You can get off trail and not have to worry about people, typically.” ADVERTISEMENT The “not have to worry about people” part of the attraction has started to change in recent years as more people discover the Badlands and what it has to offer. That includes not only deer hunting, but sharp-tailed grouse hunting, hiking, biking and other outdoor recreational activities. But it’s the deer hunting pressure that has had perhaps the greatest impact on the experience, Vournas and others say. It’s gotten to the point, Vournas says, where he doesn’t even hunt the September archery opener anymore, “just because of the amount of people that are down there.” Many of those people, he says, are hunters, often from out of state, who may not understand how to pursue deer in the rugged Badlands environment. Vournas prefers the “spot-and-stalk” technique, glassing the horizon with binoculars in hopes of spotting a mule deer bedded down and then making a slow, stealthy pursuit that can take hours. “A lot of people just go walking around with their bows thinking they’re going to shoot a mule deer,” he said. “What they don’t realize is that they’re probably not going to shoot a mule deer and they’re screwing it up for everybody else who is trying to (spot) one and then be able to make a stalk on it.” In response to the uptick in Badlands traffic and calls from the public, the North Dakota Game and Fish Department is exploring options for managing the situation. “We’ve been hearing from the public for the last few years a bit more, I would say,” said Bill Haase, assistant wildlife chief for Game and Fish in Bismarck. “Especially from archery hunters. The hunting pressure is taking away from the quality of the hunt. And then from the gun hunters – they’re getting frustrated because it’s more and more difficult to draw that coveted (mule deer) gun tag.” Allocating licenses Game and Fish sets mule deer gun licenses based on population surveys, which gives them the flexibility to adjust tag numbers as necessary, but archery licenses are trickier because the regulations are in state law. North Dakota residents can buy archery tags basically over the counter, allowing them to hunt anywhere in the state and shoot either white-tailed or mule deer. ADVERTISEMENT There’s no limit on the number of whitetail-only bow licenses available to nonresidents, but nonresident “any-deer” archery tags – allowing the harvest of either a mule deer or a whitetail – are limited, by state law, to 15% of the previous year’s mule deer rifle tag allocation. Nonresident archery tags cost $250. It’s a social issue, in part, Haase says, but it’s also becoming a biological issue as the percentage of deer harvested by archery in some Badlands hunting units approaches the percentage of deer taken by gun. “The success rate in archery hunters the last few years has been anywhere from 9% to 15%, so it’s low,” Haase said. “It’s tough to shoot a deer in the Badlands with a bow, but the effort is really high. So, when you have a lot of people doing it, it starts to add up to a meaningful harvest.” Throw in a lower mule deer population, the result of poor fawn production after severe drought in 2021 and consecutive harsh winters in 2022 and 2023, and the issue becomes even more pronounced. Mule deer populations in the Badlands have declined from more than 10 deer per square mile to “probably below six,” Haase said in November during a livestream of the Game and Fish Department’s fall advisory board meeting in Bismarck. In this screen shot, Bill Haase, assistant wildlife chief for the North Dakota Game and Fish Department, discusses hunting issues Tuesday, Nov. 21, 2023, during the Game and Fish Department's District 7 fall Advisory Board meeting in Bismarck. The meeting was livestreamed on the Game and Fish Department website. Contributed / North Dakota Game and Fish Department Fawn production last spring was the lowest ever recorded, “and that’s concerning for us,” Haase told the Herald. “It’s been kind of a tough go here for a while, and our numbers have dropped – our densities are lower out there,” Haase said in an interview. “They’re OK – it’s not like we’re not going to recover from it. They’re down, but not drastically down because we’ve been very conservative with our gun tag allocation.” In 2023, Game and Fish offered 862 nonresident “any deer” bow licenses statewide. In response to the population decline, the department drastically cut mule deer gun licenses in 2023 – 2,250, compared with 5,750 in 2022 – but this year’s nonresident “any deer” bow tag allocation was higher than it should have been, Haase says, because of the state law requiring that nonresident any-deer bow licenses be set at 15% of the previous year’s mule deer gun tag allocation. ADVERTISEMENT Contributed / North Dakota Game and Fish Department Next year, nonresident “any deer” bow tags will “drop dramatically,” Haase said, because fewer mule deer gun licenses were available this year. “It’ll be a big drop (in 2024) because it’s a year delay on that, and so that’s kind of unfortunate,” he said. “We’re not able to be as reactive with that (nonresident “any deer” archery) tag allocation as it should be.” The past three years, Haase says, Game and Fish has expanded its post-hunting season archery surveys in an effort to learn more about where bowhunters are going and whether certain times of archery season are busier than others. “We found it’s busy, and it’s busy throughout the season,” he said. Tackling the issue In an effort to gain even more insight into the Badlands issue, Game and Fish last spring assembled a three-person “Badlands License Working Group,” which included a representative from the North Dakota Bowhunters Association, a representative from the North Dakota Chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers and a certified Pope and Young scorer with ties to landowners and the Mule Deer Foundation. The group met twice in the spring and early summer, said Brock Wahl of Bismarck, co-chairman of the North Dakota Backcountry Hunters and Anglers chapter who was part of the group. Brock Wahl of Bismarck, co-chairman of the North Dakota Chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. Contributed / Backcountry Hunters and Anglers “In those meetings, we went over some of the data that Game and Fish had – what they’re seeing with that data, what they’re hearing from hunters, and some of that is just what’s going on in the rumor mill,” Wahl said. “Is there a lot of people concerned about it, or is it just a few people, or what’s going on – is it rifle hunters, bowhunters, landowners – what’s happening here?” In response to those meetings, Game and Fish contracted with a Colorado firm, HDNR Consulting LLC, to develop a survey, which was sent in September to a random sample of 8,000 North Dakota resident deer hunters. ADVERTISEMENT Out of those 8,000 hunters, more than 4,000 responded, and Game and Fish is in the early stages of analyzing the report, which is about 55 pages long, Haase says. “One of the takeaways was that the majority of people are interested in some type of specific management of these archery licenses,” Haase said. “It’s certainly something that we’re going to look at (for) nonresidents and residents,” in terms of how archery licenses are allocated. One thing’s for sure: Whatever changes ultimately result – if any – won’t be to everyone’s liking. “No matter what we do, I can assure you not everybody will agree with us,” Haase said. “There’s people on each end and everywhere across the middle. And there’s a lot of different ways to go, so it’s tough.” Max Hoefs of Grand Forks, who moved to North Dakota from Minnesota in the early 2000s, says he’s been hunting the Badlands since about 2006 and so far this year has spent about three weeks in the rugged country trying to fill his archery tag. “I fell in love with the Western-type of hunting; the spot-and stalk part of it is a little more challenging than sitting in a tree stand for whitetails,” he said. “Sitting on a nice butte, sitting on a nice hillside with a good pair of binoculars and just enjoying nature and looking for a good mule deer. … That’s how I fell in love with the out-West (style of hunting).” Like other resident archery hunters, Hoefs says he appreciates being able to purchase a license every year. On one hand, Hoefs says, he’d like to see fewer nonresident archery hunters in the Badlands – or perhaps even none – but understands the revenue that nonresident license fees bring to the Game and Fish Department. “I’d be really sad as a North Dakota resident not being able to bow hunt in the state” every year, Hoefs said. “But if it was proven that, ‘Hey, if we do this, if we cut the number of tags back, the deer population (and) the success rate would be better,’ would I be for it? Honestly, I don’t know.” ADVERTISEMENT The broad range of opinions definitely adds to the challenge, says Wahl of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. “Everybody’s got an opinion about what’s going to work and what’s best for them. And I’m no different,” Wahl said. “I have my own biases, and I think the challenging thing for us as a chapter is this is going to be a difficult issue for us to really come out strong in support of one particular idea or concept because, with social issues, you’re going to have a lot of unique and passionate opinions. Everybody has their opinion of what’s best. And so as an organization, it would be very difficult for us to come out really strong in support of something and expect that all of our membership is going to be in unified agreement with that.” What’s next Once Game and Fish has analyzed the survey results, the department will meet in January with the Badlands License Working Group and hold public meetings around the state sometime in February or March to gather additional input, said Haase, the assistant wildlife chief. Whatever regulation changes are implemented for next fall, if any, will have to be included in the proclamation of proposed 2024 big game hunting regulations due at the governor’s office in mid-April, Haase said. Others would require legislative action because they’re in state law. “We don’t have to do everything this year,” he said. “Maybe we’ll implement some things this year and then analyze, see what happens and then adjust accordingly. “I don’t know yet, we’ll see. We haven’t made any determinations.” Change is often difficult, and this process is no different, Wahl said. “What we’re talking about here is changing a really long history of the way things have been done in North Dakota,” Wahl said. “And whether or not there’s going to be a change, I don’t know at this point. But I do think when you’re talking about these hunting traditions, tag allocation and season setting, those are tied to our traditions, and so anytime you’re talking about a change like this, which could affect archery and rifle seasons and how often you get to go hunting with certain weapons, that’s a big deal.

        "description": "...plus the series finale of The Crown on Netflix, Mark Wahlberg in The Family Plan on Apple TV+ and more!",
        "content": "From the final season of The Crown to the latest Mark Wahlberg action comedy, there’s something new for everyone this week! Not sure which new releases to check out? Let us here at Decider help you figure out what to watch this weekend and where to stream it. The end of Netflix’s The Crown is upon us, and all six of the show’s final episodes are now available to watch. On Prime Video, it’s the return of everyone’s favorite strong and silent type, Jack Reacher, in Reacher . And on Apple TV+, Mark Wahlberg, Michelle Monaghan, and Maggie Q star in The Family Plan about a man (Wahlberg) trying to keep his past as an assassin hidden from his wife and kids. After six seasons, multiple cast changes, and a gamut of emotions, The Crown is coming to an end at Netflix this week. The show, which has been a flagship series for the streamer, has gone from historical drama to tabloid fodder with the newest season focusing on the death of Princess Diana and the rise of Prince William. The final six episodes came out Thursday, December 14. Like the book series that it’s based on, Prime Video’s Reacher plops it’s main character, retired Army officer Jack Reacher (Alan Ritchson), into different crime-filled situations that he has to resolve using his hulking body and interior monologues. Most of the cast for season two is new, save for Ritchson, and Reacher has moved on from Margrave, Georgia to California where he’s trying to solve the mysterious deaths of members of his old Army unit. (This season will be based on Lee Child’s 11th book in his series, Bad Look and Trouble .) The first three episodes of Reacher season 2 are out now, with new episodes airing weekly. If it’s been a minute since you’ve watched a movie about a retired assassin who’s been forced back into the killer lifestyle despite his attempts to be a normal guy, might we suggest The Family Plan , starring Mark Wahlberg? In the Apple TV+ film, Wahlberg stars as Dan Morgan, a married father of three whose identity as a former government assassin has been discovered by an old foe. In an attempt to protect his family, he takes them on a road trip to Las Vegas where he plans to keep them safe, while fending off the enemy who wants him dead. The options above only scratch the surface, so you know that this weekend’s full lineup will have amazing options for what to watch this weekend!

Stompy Lug-Sole Boots Beloved for its toothy rubber sole, the is ideal for navigating inclement weather.

Heavyweight Wool Trousers The pleated tailored trouser is still a wonderful option for the winter months, as it wears well with and sweaters.

        "content": "Another rotation around the sun means another year stacked with memes. But considering how fast-paced the world of social media can be, you’d be forgiven for not remembering viral tweet or trend that had you chuckling under the covers at odd hours of the morning this year. So, to help jog your memory, has rounded up the best memes of 2023. Whether you’re here to relive the glory days of the Barbenheimer phenomenon or experience another level of second-hand cringe at the words follow along as we unveil the best memes of the year. Gag City What’s Gag City, you ask? Ahead of releasing , tweeted a captioned “Approaching Gag City.” Quick to respond (and start a new meme), the Barbz conjured images of the rose-tinted metropolis using AI—even going so far as to assign political leadership to it (with Minaj, of course, the leader). Pingu Dead-Staring to Mozart The likes of Mozart and Beethoven could not have possibly imagined their compositions backing silly little videos of animated penguins on billions of phones across the world. The thought makes it all the funnier when I see Pingu, a kids’ show character, staring wide-eyed as Mozart’s “Lacrimosa” plays. HUH Cat Who doesn’t love a cat meme? When you don’t understand something, or just can’t hear the person talking to you and need them to repeat themselves for the third time in a row, referencing the “HUH?” cat will get your point across. I’m Just a Girl To clarify, no, this is not a play on Julia Roberts’s monologue. “I’m just a girl” emerged as a reaction to the crushing burdens of modern womanhood, justifying a certain kind of indulgence. Why are you tired between 3 and 5 p.m.? Why do you deserve a coffee and sweet treat in the middle of the day,? Because you’re just a girl trying to make it all work. Squirtle Playing the Saxophone That’s it! That’s the meme. It’s a Pokémon with sunglasses, blowing away on the saxophone to the tune of “Run Away” by SunStroke Project. The mirrors a of “Epic Sax Guy” doing the same, and it’s just a mood. Who’s That Wonderful Girl? Could She Be Any Cuter? Thank you to whoever started this meme for forcing me to listen to some positive affirmations. The viral clip comes from , an old Canadian children’s show. DJ Khalid Says the Darndest Things Call me Tiger Woods, because I’m about to drive this point home: I’ve been reprimanded far too many times for saying “LET’S GO GOLFING” in the tone of DJ Khalid, and it’s all because of this internet meme. Someone out there thought it was a good idea to “bring out the whole ocean” of DJ Khalid’s most out-of-pocket, out-of-context sayings, and the result is perfect: Usher, EryKah Badu, and Quavo Front Row at Marni What’s better than one star’s masterclass in fashion-week dressing? A group serve. The three performers were front row at Marni’s spring 2024 show in head-turning ’fits—and once the images hit the web, they immediately took off. Vince McMahon Tearing Up Not much needs to be said about this meme except it’s too real. The clip comes from a documentary in which former WWE CEO Vince McMahon is asked how much wrestling champion The Undertaker meant to him. Overwhelmed with emotion, McMahon motions to cut the cameras. Online, users coopted the moment for their own objects of nostalgic longing. Josh Hutcherson Rick Rolls the Internet Move over, Rick Astley, because Gen-Z Netizens have officially dubbed this of Josh Hutcherson the modern Rickroll. As a die-hard fan who witnessed the birth of videos like these in real time (#TeamPeeta), it’s no surprise a piece of fan history has reclaimed its rightful place at the forefront of internet virality. AI Cartoons Characters in Their Feelings Social media users have found all kinds of creative uses for artificial intelligence. What began—controversially—with some using AI to make their favorite artists sing songs from other musicians (or even rap original music), the internet has moved on to depicting their favorite cartoon characters in their feelings, at the top of their game, or simply balling out. This Stock Photo of Kevin James Caption a photo of Kevin James dressed as his character from , looking sheepishly at the camera with his hands in his pockets, and you have yourself a viral meme. Video of Jeremy Allen White Since became a hit, many started pulling clips of from his days. One went viral simply for the off-centered stare White gives the camera. Cats at the Met Gala The Met Gala always attracts attention online, as people breathlessly check how their favorite stars interpreted the theme. At this year’s event, Doja Cat and Lil Nas X seemed to take the cake with their glittery feline ensembles. Ariana DeBose at the BAFTAs The star’s monologue-rap at the BAFTAs sparked a number of cringe-filled reactions, but one thing viewers couldn’t seem to forget was the vague lyric “Angela Bassett did the thing.” Dylan Sprouse and Barbara Palvin Marry When photos of went viral online, users congratulated the couple in a funny, nostalgic way, citing Sprouse’s days promoting the when he was a Disney Channel star. All Gen-Z kids can remember trying—and failing—to win. When Everyone Started Dissecting the Physics of A lot of hilarious internet discourse ensues when one user poses a question that goes absolutely viral. In this case, it was when @KevOnStage , “What was the moment Fast and Furious abandoned reality.” The internet had a lot to say—and a lot of content to work with, since the franchise is at 10 films and counting. Taylor Swift Fans Take Ticketmaster Down “Ticketmaster-gate” will go down in history as the time Swifties toppled Ticketmaster; fans sued the company after they were unable to buy tickets to Swift’s Eras Tour. The fracas garnered a from Taylor Swift herself, and not only resulted in a lawsuit but also . Breaks the Internet Shoutout to ’s marketing team for their master class in social media mayhem ahead of the film’s July release. For a period of time, you couldn’t go online without seeing something related to the bleach-blonde doll; from memes like “Hi Barbie” to “She’s everything, he’s just Ken,” ’s relevance lasted years in internet terms. When posters for the film were first revealed, the internet wasted no time casting their own favs into the mix. After fans learned that and would be released on the same day, they joked about watching the two back to back, citing the humorously stark contrast between the rose-colored feel-good film and serious historical biopic. Then fans then started comparing Barbenheimer to with seemingly opposite vibes. One ticket to and anyone? Even Margot Robbie and Cillian Murphy seemed to get in on the fun… fans also meme-d about the funny character dynamics in the film, specifically between Barbie, with her capacity to be and do everything, and…Ken. This format went viral, too: Twitter Is Now “X” When Elon Musk announced Twitter’s rebrand to “X,” many users weren’t happy, clowning on the change that no one signed up for. Astro Boy Boots Is this where the trend started? Once the internet caught wind of these cartoonish red boots from MSCHF, the memes sort of wrote themselves. Stop Normalizing the Grind… Romanticizing anything that resembled the quiet life—a cozy-girl mentality, a sleepy woodland animal—became a trend. Because, frankly, there something beautifully aspirational about a picture of Winnie the Pooh wrapped up in a blanket drinking tea. Iterations of the meme also come in the form of “the sexual tension between me and [insert cozy activity here],” and “the feminine urge to…” Honk Shoo-ing In the vein of romanticizing coziness, the vibe of the SleepyTime Tea Bear became universally coveted this year. “Honk shoo,” the sound a fictional bear might make while passed out in an armchair, appeared in almost every tweet that described emulating the tea bear’s sensibility. Some even took it a step further, and tried to “steal his look”—making outfit breakdowns a part of the meme too. Pedro Pascal and Nicholas Cage This clip from went viral, as social media users latched on to Pedro Pascal’s wholesome demeanor and Nicholas Cage’s outrageous stare. They’re Playing Football During a Rihanna Concert Considering Rihanna’s Super Bowl Halftime show was the halftime performance of all time, it’s not a surprise that the internet was in a frenzy before, during, and after what people jokingly called a Rihanna concert…with some football.",

        "content": "As we prepare for the sight of Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa, here's a look back at his career arc from romantic leading man to whatever it is he's doing now When you’ve been in the moviemaking business for as long as Hugh Grant has, you’ve earned the right to take whatever kinds of chances you want in the roles you choose. If that means poking a little fun at your own image as an aging, curmudgeonly actor whose best roles may be behind him (though we’d argue that’s certainly not true) or going completely off the rails as a digitally created Oompa Loompa in the new film, that’s your prerogative. After years of struggling to get away from the kinds of romantic roles he was being offered after his breakthrough performance in , it’s been fascinating to track the progression of Grant’s projects as he continues to push boundaries on his own terms. If he ever cared what audiences thought of him, he certainly doesn’t anymore. And lately it seems as if he’s found a new sort of niche that suits him. That doesn’t mean we love his performances in beloved rom-coms like and any less. He’s an actor of many talents. Here, then, are our favorite Hugh Grant performances ranging from the most stable characters to the most delightfully unhinged. 2 / 17 15. (1999) 15. (1999) Hugh Grant’s humble London-based bookseller Will in is as stable as they come—that’s the whole point of the character (it’s Rhys Ifans who gets to be truly unhinged here as his flatmate Spike). Will is a grounding presence in the looking-glass Hollywood life of American superstar Anna Scott (Julia Roberts). Despite a conscious effort to play against type in the years following his breakout role in , Grant reunited with screenwriter Richard Curtis after reading the script for , which was too good to turn down. Even now, two and a half decades later, it hasn’t lost any of its unapologetically romantic charm. 3 / 17 14. (1995) 14. (1995) If 1994’s solidified Hugh Grant’s status as a romantic lead, the Jane Austen adaptation , released the following year, showed audiences that he could do it even better in period dress. His Edward Ferrars makes an enchanting first impression, but disappears for a good chunk of the film, reappearing only at the climax to haltingly reveal his true feelings to Emma Thompson’s Elinor Dashwood. That brief scene, and both Grant’s and Thompson’s performance in it, is the perfect capper to a bright and bountiful film full of memorable moments. 4 / 17 13. (1995) 13. (1995) The unhinged length of this film’s title alone should indicate a non-zero level of whimsy without knowing anything else about it. And that’s not too far from the truth. With his star on the rise after hits like and , Grant appeared in the quaint little indie as a cartographer who travels to a Welsh village during World War I to assess whether the local geological feature qualifies as a hill or a mountain. Surrounded by colorful local characters, he does exactly what was expected of him at this point in his career. He’s a bit stiff, a bit flustered, and a bit charming, often all at the same time. 5 / 17 12. (1994) 12. (1994) Unless you lived through it, it’s hard to explain the cultural impact that had on the mid-1990s. It was . And so was Hugh Grant, stumbling through a love confession to Andie MacDowell through the words of David Cassidy (when he was still with The Partridge Family). It was the first of what turned out to be several immensely successful collaborations between Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis that catapulted him from a relatively unknown British actor to a worldwide star. As Charles, his boyish good looks are undercut by his social awkwardness, dry wit, and plenty of self-deprecation. The role would shape his career, for better or worse, for the following decade. 6 / 17 11. (1988) 11. (1988) Before he became a recognizable star, Hugh Grant was making some real offbeat choices in film projects. Take for example, the late ’80s cult classic , in which he plays a British aristocrat whose ancestral Derbyshire home happens to be situated next to a cavern inhabited by an ancient serpentine creature and the immortal priestess who serves it. Directed by Ken Russell and loosely based on a lesser-known Bram Stoker novel, it’s as bonkers as you might expect. As the plucky young hero, Grant doesn’t get to have as much campy fun as the baddies in the one, but based on some of his later performances, he was clearly taking notes. 7 / 17 10. (2002) 10. (2002) Based on the book by Nick Hornby, manages to be heartfelt without ever losing its edge. Grant’s layered performance as Will, an independently wealthy bachelor who forms an unexpected connection with a tragically uncool middle schooler (played by a babyfaced Nicholas Hoult), is a big part of why the film succeeds as well as it does. Will isn’t as romantically idealistic as some other characters Grant has played—he can be duplicitous and manipulative—but his heart’s ultimately in the right place. It feels like just the right balance of sweet and salty for Grant at this stage of his career. 8 / 17 9. (1995) 9. (1995) might be best remembered for a fluke of timing. It came out around the same time Grant was famously arrested for soliciting a sex worker near the Sunset Strip. The proximity of the two events meant that he had to do the press tour for the film while the scandal was unfolding in the tabloids in real-time, leading to an iconic in which Grant defused the situation with his trademark self-effacing humor. That might have been his best performance of the year, though he’s not bad in the film as an increasingly nervous father-to-be. That said, we had to throw in a few extra points towards the unhinged end of the scale just for that extremely floppy hairdo. 9 / 17 8. (2003) 8. (2003) In a film overstuffed with too many characters and intertwining plots, Grant’s storyline as the newly elected Prime Minister who falls for a junior staffer (played by Martine McCutcheon) has always stood out as a fan-favorite in . Chalk it up to another successful team-up with screenwriter Richard Curtis. Grant now talks about how much he dreaded filming the famous scene when his character celebrates his political triumph over the American president (Billy Bob Thornton), but if he didn’t want the image of him dancing through 10 Downing Street to The Pointer Sisters forever burned into our brains, he shouldn’t have done such a good job at it. Afraid it’s too late now, sir. 10 / 17 7. (2007) 7. (2007) Some of the best bits in were the scenes where the film played up the concept of Hugh Grant as a 1980s pop star, both in his heyday and as a washed-up has-been. It’s a fun metatextual angle that directly references Grant’s status as a romantic lead in a late-career rom-com. The big age gap between him and his co-star love interest Drew Barrymore could have been an insurmountable obstacle, but the two actually have a good amount of on-screen chemistry that works in the film’s favor. Perhaps the musical talents he showcased here led to more opportunities to make use of them in films like and . 11 / 17 6. (2001) 6. (2001) According to Hugh Grant, screenwriter Richard Curtis always found it amusing that he was so often cast as such nice, affable blokes when he’s quite the opposite in real life. That public-private contrast clearly factored into his role in as Daniel Cleaver, a modern equivalent of ’s dastardly Mr. Wickham. You can easily see why Bridget (Renée Zellweger) would fall for him, and when his true nature is revealed, it’s devastating. Grant’s performance makes Daniel’s turn from handsome heartthrob to loathsome slimeball seem all too real. 12 / 17 5. (2002) 5. (2002) After Grant made the transition from nice guy to jerk in , he did the reverse as Sandra Bullock’s love interest and boss in . He plays a rich, self-important real estate developer who hires Bullock as his Chief Counsel and becomes so reliant on her for his every need, she gets fed up and quits. It’s during the two weeks after she gives notice that the two of them realize they might actually like each other for real. The movie itself is a fairly standard by-the-numbers rom-com, but Grant and Bullock’s performances elevate it with an acidic chemistry that makes it fun to watch. Two rom-com giants at the top of their game. 13 / 17 4. (1995) 4. (1995) Twenty years before he played drama king Phoenix Buchanan in , Hugh Grant sleazed it up as a predatory theatrical director in , a heavy drama (don’t be fooled by the cheery tone of the trailer) based on the acclaimed novel by Beryl Bainbridge. Grant has played his share of villains over the years, but Meredith Potter might be the most despicable, because of how true to life his sociopathy feels. Reuniting with director Mike Newell, Grant seems desperate to shake off the shackles of typecasting with this film, set in dreary post-World War II Liverpool. Meredith is a monster who callously uses his position of power to prey on boys, girls, or anyone who shows the slightest interest. It’s a supporting role, but he nearly steals the show from co-star Alan Rickman (not an easy thing to do) and a young Georgina Cates. 14 / 17 3. (2016) 3. (2016) In seeking to distance himself from the kinds of romantic roles he played earlier in his career, Grant has perhaps stumbled into another archetype that might suit him even better (and he would probably agree)—the overly theatrical narcissist. His character in is another variation on that theme, and was acclaimed as one of the best performances of his career up to that point. Based on the true story of a wealthy socialite (Meryl Streep, who was nominated for an Oscar in the role) who believed she had talent as an opera singer because no one would dare tell her otherwise, Grant plays Florence’s husband and manager, St. Clair Bayfield. He’s a character with murky motivations, having given up his own acting career to support his untalented wife, and Grant lets you see all the interesting facets within him, even (and especially) the flaws. 15 / 17 2. (2023) 2. (2023) Perhaps all the acclaim Grant received for his campy, over-the-top performance in inspired him to take on another baddie in From the moment we meet slippery rogue Forge Fitzwilliam, his arc from ally to adversary to the grandstanding Lord of Neverwinter is fairly predictable, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t tons of fun to watch Grant chew every bit of scenery within reach. Now that he’s fully in the DGAF phase of his career (just listen to any of his recent interviews), we’d encourage the directors of his future projects to let him off the leash more often. The results are frequently dazzling. 16 / 17 1. (2017) 1. (2017) When filmmaker Paul King first sent the script to Hugh Grant, the character of Phoenix Buchanan, a “washed-up narcissistic old actor” (in Grant’s words), was called Hugh. Grant could have chosen to take that personally and refused to have anything to do with the project, but instead, he embraced it. The performance he gives in the film is one of his best and one of his most unhinged. In a quest to hunt down a hidden treasure using clues from a pop-up book in Paddington’s possession, he employs a series of eccentric disguises to trick the poor, innocent bear. If Grant didn’t have a blast making the film, he did a fine job of making it look as though he did. 17 / 17",

        "content": "Discovery-owned Eurosport has acquired streaming rights in 54 countries to Olympic refugee documentary “ We Dare to Dream ” by Waad Al-Kateab, the Oscar-nominated Syrian director of “For Sama.” “We Dare to Dream” is the story of the refugee Olympic team that competed at the 2020 games in Tokyo, which featured stateless athletes from Iran, Syria, South Sudan and Cameroon who swim, run and fight their way to safety in host nations across the world. It’s told through the personal prism of Al-Kateab while she is coming to terms with the reality that she can never return to Aleppo, where she shot “For Sama.” The doc premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in June and had an Oscar-qualifying theatrical run at New York City’s IFC Center in October. After the doc premiered at Tribeca, Angelina Jolie joined “We Dare to Dream” as an executive producer to help with its Oscar push. Five months later, John Legend also signed on to exec produce with his Get Lifted Film banner co-founders Mike Jackson and Ty Stiklorious. Legend also wrote, composed and performed an original song for the doc, titled “Don’t Need to Sleep.” Peacock acquired U.S. rights to “We Dare to Dream” earlier this month. Peacock and NBC are official U.S. broadcasters of the Olympics, while Eurosport is home of the Olympic Games in Europe. Besides Eurosport play across Europe and beyond – the deal also includes some non-EU territories such as Turkey, Ukraine and Uzbekistan – streaming availability of “We Dare to Dream” will now also comprise Discovery+ in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom and Ireland. “I’m so grateful to Eurosport for bringing this film to 54 countries across the world,” said Al-Kateab in a statement. “I hope people will now be able to understand how the world’s refugees, like me, are not the crisis but rather a result of several global crises from political violence to climate change that are making millions of refugees, like me, face unimaginable challenges.” In her conversation with Jolie about “We Dare to Dream,” Al-Kateab notes that “the sports element is very important in the film; but it’s not about that. Even being refugees themselves, it was very important and played a big part, but [it] wasn’t about that at all. I think for me – what I really wanted people to take away from the film – is what comes after? What’s going to happen to these people after this experience?” Jolie said that “what brings displaced people together is so different and so extraordinary” and points out that there are “110 million people in the world that understand what it is to be forced from their homeland and to live displaced.” She continued, “I was very moved when I realized there was a refugee Olympic team, because to me it is a country in many ways.” Watch the full conversation below.",

His second favorite, Donny Hathaway's \"This Christmas,\" comes in at No. 3 on his playlist, and he rounds it out with a pick from Boys II Men. TODAY's resident musical expert Carson Daly picked 13 songs for his playlist, which features many holiday classics covered by current and former coaches on \"The Voice,\" like Blake Shelton, Reba McEntire, CeeLo Green and more. For those participating in Whamageddon : avoid Sheinelle's playlist. But picks from Faith Hill, Whitney Houston and more make hers pretty irresistible. Dylan topped her playlist with her own favorite holiday song , \"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\" by U2, while tracks from Bruce Springsteen, Mavis Staples and Run-DMC follow. Jenna also gave some love to \"Carefree Christmas,\" her holiday duet with Hoda , as well as picking out favorites from Justin Bieber, Carrie Underwood, Madonna and The Pogues, whose frontman, Shane MacGowan, died at 65 last month .",

Fabulous Faux Fur Coats This winter’s ultimate is undoubtedly the fabulous faux fur coat, worn adoringly by both fashion girls and editors alike. Options from Toteme and H&M are true-to-the-classics, while belted faux furs from The Frankie Shop and Mackage offer up a cinched-waist silhouette that brings definition to an otherwise voluminous silhouette. Warming Winter Dresses A casual knit or wool is a one-and-done piece that makes everyday winter dressing effortless. Opt for Mango’s turtleneck dress or Toteme’s flannel frock, both of which go from commute-to-cocktail all too chicly.

        "content": "Another rotation around the sun means another year stacked with memes. But considering how fast-paced the world of social media can be, you’d be forgiven for not remembering viral tweet or trend that had you chuckling under the covers at odd hours of the morning this year. So, to help jog your memory, has rounded up the best memes of 2023. Whether you’re here to relive the glory days of the Barbenheimer phenomenon or experience another level of second-hand cringe at the words follow along as we unveil the best memes of the year. Gag City What’s Gag City, you ask? Ahead of releasing , tweeted a captioned “Approaching Gag City.” Quick to respond (and start a new meme), the Barbz conjured images of the rose-tinted metropolis using AI—even going so far as to assign political leadership to it (with Minaj, of course, the leader). Pingu Dead-Staring to Mozart The likes of Mozart and Beethoven could not have possibly imagined their compositions backing silly little videos of animated penguins on billions of phones across the world. The thought makes it all the funnier when I see Pingu, a kids’ show character, staring wide-eyed as Mozart’s “Lacrimosa” plays. HUH Cat Who doesn’t love a cat meme? When you don’t understand something, or just can’t hear the person talking to you and need them to repeat themselves for the third time in a row, referencing the “HUH?” cat will get your point across. I’m Just a Girl To clarify, no, this is not a play on Julia Roberts’s monologue. “I’m just a girl” emerged as a reaction to the crushing burdens of modern womanhood, justifying a certain kind of indulgence. Why are you tired between 3 and 5 p.m.? Why do you deserve a coffee and sweet treat in the middle of the day,? Because you’re just a girl trying to make it all work. Squirtle Playing the Saxophone That’s it! That’s the meme. It’s a Pokémon with sunglasses, blowing away on the saxophone to the tune of “Run Away” by SunStroke Project. The mirrors a of “Epic Sax Guy” doing the same, and it’s just a mood. Who’s That Wonderful Girl? Could She Be Any Cuter? Thank you to whoever started this meme for forcing me to listen to some positive affirmations. The viral clip comes from , an old Canadian children’s show. DJ Khalid Says the Darndest Things Call me Tiger Woods, because I’m about to drive this point home: I’ve been reprimanded far too many times for saying “LET’S GO GOLFING” in the tone of DJ Khalid, and it’s all because of this internet meme. Someone out there thought it was a good idea to “bring out the whole ocean” of DJ Khalid’s most out-of-pocket, out-of-context sayings, and the result is perfect: Usher, EryKah Badu, and Quavo Front Row at Marni What’s better than one star’s masterclass in fashion-week dressing? A group serve. The three performers were front row at Marni’s spring 2024 show in head-turning ’fits—and once the images hit the web, they immediately took off. Vince McMahon Tearing Up Not much needs to be said about this meme except it’s too real. The clip comes from a documentary in which former WWE CEO Vince McMahon is asked how much wrestling champion The Undertaker meant to him. Overwhelmed with emotion, McMahon motions to cut the cameras. Online, users coopted the moment for their own objects of nostalgic longing. Josh Hutcherson Rick Rolls the Internet Move over, Rick Astley, because Gen-Z Netizens have officially dubbed this of Josh Hutcherson the modern Rickroll. As a die-hard fan who witnessed the birth of videos like these in real time (#TeamPeeta), it’s no surprise a piece of fan history has reclaimed its rightful place at the forefront of internet virality. AI Cartoons Characters in Their Feelings Social media users have found all kinds of creative uses for artificial intelligence. What began—controversially—with some using AI to make their favorite artists sing songs from other musicians (or even rap original music), the internet has moved on to depicting their favorite cartoon characters in their feelings, at the top of their game, or simply balling out. This Stock Photo of Kevin James Caption a photo of Kevin James dressed as his character from , looking sheepishly at the camera with his hands in his pockets, and you have yourself a viral meme. Video of Jeremy Allen White Since became a hit, many started pulling clips of from his days. One went viral simply for the off-centered stare White gives the camera. Cats at the Met Gala The Met Gala always attracts attention online, as people breathlessly check how their favorite stars interpreted the theme. At this year’s event, Doja Cat and Lil Nas X seemed to take the cake with their glittery feline ensembles. Ariana DeBose at the BAFTAs The star’s monologue-rap at the BAFTAs sparked a number of cringe-filled reactions, but one thing viewers couldn’t seem to forget was the vague lyric “Angela Bassett did the thing.” Dylan Sprouse and Barbara Palvin Marry When photos of went viral online, users congratulated the couple in a funny, nostalgic way, citing Sprouse’s days promoting the when he was a Disney Channel star. All Gen-Z kids can remember trying—and failing—to win. When Everyone Started Dissecting the Physics of A lot of hilarious internet discourse ensues when one user poses a question that goes absolutely viral. In this case, it was when @KevOnStage , “What was the moment Fast and Furious abandoned reality.” The internet had a lot to say—and a lot of content to work with, since the franchise is at 10 films and counting. Taylor Swift Fans Take Ticketmaster Down “Ticketmaster-gate” will go down in history as the time Swifties toppled Ticketmaster; fans sued the company after they were unable to buy tickets to Swift’s Eras Tour. The fracas garnered a from Taylor Swift herself, and not only resulted in a lawsuit but also . Breaks the Internet Shoutout to ’s marketing team for their master class in social media mayhem ahead of the film’s July release. For a period of time, you couldn’t go online without seeing something related to the bleach-blonde doll; from memes like “Hi Barbie” to “She’s everything, he’s just Ken,” ’s relevance lasted years in internet terms. When posters for the film were first revealed, the internet wasted no time casting their own favs into the mix. After fans learned that and would be released on the same day, they joked about watching the two back to back, citing the humorously stark contrast between the rose-colored feel-good film and serious historical biopic. Then fans then started comparing Barbenheimer to with seemingly opposite vibes. One ticket to and anyone? Even Margot Robbie and Cillian Murphy seemed to get in on the fun… fans also meme-d about the funny character dynamics in the film, specifically between Barbie, with her capacity to be and do everything, and…Ken. This format went viral, too: Twitter Is Now “X” When Elon Musk announced Twitter’s rebrand to “X,” many users weren’t happy, clowning on the change that no one signed up for. Astro Boy Boots Is this where the trend started? Once the internet caught wind of these cartoonish red boots from MSCHF, the memes sort of wrote themselves. Stop Normalizing the Grind… Romanticizing anything that resembled the quiet life—a cozy-girl mentality, a sleepy woodland animal—became a trend. Because, frankly, there something beautifully aspirational about a picture of Winnie the Pooh wrapped up in a blanket drinking tea. Iterations of the meme also come in the form of “the sexual tension between me and [insert cozy activity here],” and “the feminine urge to…” Honk Shoo-ing In the vein of romanticizing coziness, the vibe of the SleepyTime Tea Bear became universally coveted this year. “Honk shoo,” the sound a fictional bear might make while passed out in an armchair, appeared in almost every tweet that described emulating the tea bear’s sensibility. Some even took it a step further, and tried to “steal his look”—making outfit breakdowns a part of the meme too. Pedro Pascal and Nicholas Cage This clip from went viral, as social media users latched on to Pedro Pascal’s wholesome demeanor and Nicholas Cage’s outrageous stare. They’re Playing Football During a Rihanna Concert Considering Rihanna’s Super Bowl Halftime show was the halftime performance of all time, it’s not a surprise that the internet was in a frenzy before, during, and after what people jokingly called a Rihanna concert…with some football.",

        "content": "Reacher Season 2: Is Willa Fitzgerald’s Roscoe in the New Season? By has just dropped and fans are curious about whether or not from the first season will be in the new season. Here is all you need to know. Is Willa Fitzgerald’s Roscoe in Reacher Season 2? The reason for Roscoe’s absence in the second season is that Jack Reacher has moved out of Margrave, Roscoe’s hometown. Additionally, due to Reacher staying faithful to the books and closely following the story laid out by it, Roscoe’s absence is a given, evidenced by how she is not in the books after Killing Floor, the book adapted by the first season of the show. Why isn’t Roscoe in Season 2? Moreover, Reacher and Roscoe, who developed romantic feelings for each other, parted ways after realizing their relationship would not work due to Reacher’s status as a drifter who is constantly on the move and Roscoe’s dedication to staying in Margrave and making it a better place. However, as seen at the end of the first season, Reacher and Roscoe parted ways on good terms, with the Reacher suggesting Roscoe run for mayor and Roscoe giving Reacher her number and telling him to call her anytime he felt like doing so. Roscoe’s absence and exit from the series after the first season was not a shock to the actress behind her, Willa Fitzgerald, who revealed in an interview with that she was always aware that her character would only have a story arc for one season.

        "content": "As of this post, it’s nearly 8 a.m. ET, and and Ty Dolla Sign their collaborative album , which was expected to drop at midnight ET. Given West’s history of album delays and working on projects until the last possible second, this isn’t particularly surprising. This isn’t even the first time has faced a delay, as . As for why the album isn’t out yet, it looks like West was trying to cross some T’s and dot some I’s before the final buzzer. At 10:23 p.m. ET last night (December 14), 97 minutes before the album was presumably set for a midnight release, West tweeted a screenshot of a text he supposedly sent to Nicki Minaj, which read, “Hi it’s ye. May I call you about clearing new body on the new album.” . — ye (@kanyewest) , Minaj gave Kanye’s request a public “no.” During an Instagram Live broadcast last night, she said, “Child, that train has left the station, OK? No disrespect in any way. I just put out a brand new album. Now why would I put out a song that has been out for three years? Come on, guys. You know?” Nicki Minaj says she will NOT be clearing her verse to Kanye West’s “New Body” for his new album. – “That train has left the station.” — She’s Fishy ➐ (@ShesFishy) , Minaj said of “New Body,” a demo of which leaked back in 2018, “The public adored ‘New Body.’ ‘New Body’ is the biggest hit record that never came out. So what I thought was interesting was that Kanye made me write my ‘New Body’ verse four times over in order to fit into where he was creatively and spiritually in his life. […] I missed it by a year, I guess. Had ‘New Body’ been out when he was not in his gospel era, then it would’ve seen the light of day. But, it didn’t, so it wasn’t meant to be. Everybody knows that’s the hit that got away. […] I think the ship has sailed for ‘New Body,’ everybody has come to love the original way they heard it.” All that said, it is still December 15 right now, so West and Ty still have well over half a day to get everything in order and release before the weekend if that’s something they’re committed to doing.",

        "content": "Playing Jack Abbott — the patriarch of the Abbotts, the first family of “The Young and the Restless” — for 34 years, Peter Bergman has grown to have a second set of kin. “Those people get a very special place in my heart,” Bergman, who is up for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for the 24th time at the 50th Daytime Emmy Awards on Friday — which will broadcast on CBS and stream on Paramount+ live at 9 p.m. ET. So the three-time Daytime Emmy winner took it hard, right along with the rest of the “Y&R” cast, when Billy Miller — who played Jack Abbott’s younger half-brother, Billy Abbott, from 2008 to 2014, died by suicide at 43 in September after years of battling bipolar depression . “It is absolutely heartbreaking,” Bergman, 70, told The Post. “It is literally like losing a member of your family. In fact, the “Y&R” cast planned to remember Miller at their holiday party on Thursday, the day before the Daytime Emmys , in Los Angeles. “We still care about it. We’re still talking about it.” Miller was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and also starred on “General Hospital” as Jason Morgan and Drew Cain from 2014 to 2019. After his 592-episode run on the ABC daytime soap opera, Miller appeared on “Suits,” “Truth Be Told” and “NCIS.” After playing Dr. Cliff Warner on “All My Children” for 10 years, Bergman has now been at “The Young and the Restless” since 1989. But because of his sense of family at “AMC,” it was a tricky transition for him. “My job at ‘All My Children’ ended before I was ready,” said Bergman, whose supercouple romance with Taylor Miller’s Nina had ended. “They kind of decided, ‘If Nina is not going to be here, why do we need Cliff?’ So they decided to let me go. “It was heartbreaking,” he continued. “That was my first daytime family, and I was so invested in it all. And I got this job on ‘Young and the Restless,’ but my heart was still in Pine Valley [with [‘AMC’].” But after the first of his 24 Daytime Emmy nominations was for “All My Children,” Bergman went on to amass 23 more at “The Young & the Restless.” Now he is the big daddy of Y&R” — the highest-rated of the three soap operas remaining on network TV (along with “The Bold and the Beautiful” and “General Hospital” ) — which celebrated its 50th anniversary in March. “I have a kind of deep responsibility for my family members on the show,” he said. “The same way Jack does.”",

        "content": "As we prepare for the sight of Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa, here's a look back at his career arc from romantic leading man to whatever it is he's doing now When you’ve been in the moviemaking business for as long as Hugh Grant has, you’ve earned the right to take whatever kinds of chances you want in the roles you choose. If that means poking a little fun at your own image as an aging, curmudgeonly actor whose best roles may be behind him (though we’d argue that’s certainly not true) or going completely off the rails as a digitally created Oompa Loompa in the new film, that’s your prerogative. After years of struggling to get away from the kinds of romantic roles he was being offered after his breakthrough performance in , it’s been fascinating to track the progression of Grant’s projects as he continues to push boundaries on his own terms. If he ever cared what audiences thought of him, he certainly doesn’t anymore. And lately it seems as if he’s found a new sort of niche that suits him. That doesn’t mean we love his performances in beloved rom-coms like and any less. He’s an actor of many talents. Here, then, are our favorite Hugh Grant performances ranging from the most stable characters to the most delightfully unhinged. 2 / 17 15. (1999) 15. (1999) Hugh Grant’s humble London-based bookseller Will in is as stable as they come—that’s the whole point of the character (it’s Rhys Ifans who gets to be truly unhinged here as his flatmate Spike). Will is a grounding presence in the looking-glass Hollywood life of American superstar Anna Scott (Julia Roberts). Despite a conscious effort to play against type in the years following his breakout role in , Grant reunited with screenwriter Richard Curtis after reading the script for , which was too good to turn down. Even now, two and a half decades later, it hasn’t lost any of its unapologetically romantic charm. 3 / 17 14. (1995) 14. (1995) If 1994’s solidified Hugh Grant’s status as a romantic lead, the Jane Austen adaptation , released the following year, showed audiences that he could do it even better in period dress. His Edward Ferrars makes an enchanting first impression, but disappears for a good chunk of the film, reappearing only at the climax to haltingly reveal his true feelings to Emma Thompson’s Elinor Dashwood. That brief scene, and both Grant’s and Thompson’s performance in it, is the perfect capper to a bright and bountiful film full of memorable moments. 4 / 17 13. (1995) 13. (1995) The unhinged length of this film’s title alone should indicate a non-zero level of whimsy without knowing anything else about it. And that’s not too far from the truth. With his star on the rise after hits like and , Grant appeared in the quaint little indie as a cartographer who travels to a Welsh village during World War I to assess whether the local geological feature qualifies as a hill or a mountain. Surrounded by colorful local characters, he does exactly what was expected of him at this point in his career. He’s a bit stiff, a bit flustered, and a bit charming, often all at the same time. 5 / 17 12. (1994) 12. (1994) Unless you lived through it, it’s hard to explain the cultural impact that had on the mid-1990s. It was . And so was Hugh Grant, stumbling through a love confession to Andie MacDowell through the words of David Cassidy (when he was still with The Partridge Family). It was the first of what turned out to be several immensely successful collaborations between Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis that catapulted him from a relatively unknown British actor to a worldwide star. As Charles, his boyish good looks are undercut by his social awkwardness, dry wit, and plenty of self-deprecation. The role would shape his career, for better or worse, for the following decade. 6 / 17 11. (1988) 11. (1988) Before he became a recognizable star, Hugh Grant was making some real offbeat choices in film projects. Take for example, the late ’80s cult classic , in which he plays a British aristocrat whose ancestral Derbyshire home happens to be situated next to a cavern inhabited by an ancient serpentine creature and the immortal priestess who serves it. Directed by Ken Russell and loosely based on a lesser-known Bram Stoker novel, it’s as bonkers as you might expect. As the plucky young hero, Grant doesn’t get to have as much campy fun as the baddies in the one, but based on some of his later performances, he was clearly taking notes. 7 / 17 10. (2002) 10. (2002) Based on the book by Nick Hornby, manages to be heartfelt without ever losing its edge. Grant’s layered performance as Will, an independently wealthy bachelor who forms an unexpected connection with a tragically uncool middle schooler (played by a babyfaced Nicholas Hoult), is a big part of why the film succeeds as well as it does. Will isn’t as romantically idealistic as some other characters Grant has played—he can be duplicitous and manipulative—but his heart’s ultimately in the right place. It feels like just the right balance of sweet and salty for Grant at this stage of his career. 8 / 17 9. (1995) 9. (1995) might be best remembered for a fluke of timing. It came out around the same time Grant was famously arrested for soliciting a sex worker near the Sunset Strip. The proximity of the two events meant that he had to do the press tour for the film while the scandal was unfolding in the tabloids in real-time, leading to an iconic in which Grant defused the situation with his trademark self-effacing humor. That might have been his best performance of the year, though he’s not bad in the film as an increasingly nervous father-to-be. That said, we had to throw in a few extra points towards the unhinged end of the scale just for that extremely floppy hairdo. 9 / 17 8. (2003) 8. (2003) In a film overstuffed with too many characters and intertwining plots, Grant’s storyline as the newly elected Prime Minister who falls for a junior staffer (played by Martine McCutcheon) has always stood out as a fan-favorite in . Chalk it up to another successful team-up with screenwriter Richard Curtis. Grant now talks about how much he dreaded filming the famous scene when his character celebrates his political triumph over the American president (Billy Bob Thornton), but if he didn’t want the image of him dancing through 10 Downing Street to The Pointer Sisters forever burned into our brains, he shouldn’t have done such a good job at it. Afraid it’s too late now, sir. 10 / 17 7. (2007) 7. (2007) Some of the best bits in were the scenes where the film played up the concept of Hugh Grant as a 1980s pop star, both in his heyday and as a washed-up has-been. It’s a fun metatextual angle that directly references Grant’s status as a romantic lead in a late-career rom-com. The big age gap between him and his co-star love interest Drew Barrymore could have been an insurmountable obstacle, but the two actually have a good amount of on-screen chemistry that works in the film’s favor. Perhaps the musical talents he showcased here led to more opportunities to make use of them in films like and . 11 / 17 6. (2001) 6. (2001) According to Hugh Grant, screenwriter Richard Curtis always found it amusing that he was so often cast as such nice, affable blokes when he’s quite the opposite in real life. That public-private contrast clearly factored into his role in as Daniel Cleaver, a modern equivalent of ’s dastardly Mr. Wickham. You can easily see why Bridget (Renée Zellweger) would fall for him, and when his true nature is revealed, it’s devastating. Grant’s performance makes Daniel’s turn from handsome heartthrob to loathsome slimeball seem all too real. 12 / 17 5. (2002) 5. (2002) After Grant made the transition from nice guy to jerk in , he did the reverse as Sandra Bullock’s love interest and boss in . He plays a rich, self-important real estate developer who hires Bullock as his Chief Counsel and becomes so reliant on her for his every need, she gets fed up and quits. It’s during the two weeks after she gives notice that the two of them realize they might actually like each other for real. The movie itself is a fairly standard by-the-numbers rom-com, but Grant and Bullock’s performances elevate it with an acidic chemistry that makes it fun to watch. Two rom-com giants at the top of their game. 13 / 17 4. (1995) 4. (1995) Twenty years before he played drama king Phoenix Buchanan in , Hugh Grant sleazed it up as a predatory theatrical director in , a heavy drama (don’t be fooled by the cheery tone of the trailer) based on the acclaimed novel by Beryl Bainbridge. Grant has played his share of villains over the years, but Meredith Potter might be the most despicable, because of how true to life his sociopathy feels. Reuniting with director Mike Newell, Grant seems desperate to shake off the shackles of typecasting with this film, set in dreary post-World War II Liverpool. Meredith is a monster who callously uses his position of power to prey on boys, girls, or anyone who shows the slightest interest. It’s a supporting role, but he nearly steals the show from co-star Alan Rickman (not an easy thing to do) and a young Georgina Cates. 14 / 17 3. (2016) 3. (2016) In seeking to distance himself from the kinds of romantic roles he played earlier in his career, Grant has perhaps stumbled into another archetype that might suit him even better (and he would probably agree)—the overly theatrical narcissist. His character in is another variation on that theme, and was acclaimed as one of the best performances of his career up to that point. Based on the true story of a wealthy socialite (Meryl Streep, who was nominated for an Oscar in the role) who believed she had talent as an opera singer because no one would dare tell her otherwise, Grant plays Florence’s husband and manager, St. Clair Bayfield. He’s a character with murky motivations, having given up his own acting career to support his untalented wife, and Grant lets you see all the interesting facets within him, even (and especially) the flaws. 15 / 17 2. (2023) 2. (2023) Perhaps all the acclaim Grant received for his campy, over-the-top performance in inspired him to take on another baddie in From the moment we meet slippery rogue Forge Fitzwilliam, his arc from ally to adversary to the grandstanding Lord of Neverwinter is fairly predictable, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t tons of fun to watch Grant chew every bit of scenery within reach. Now that he’s fully in the DGAF phase of his career (just listen to any of his recent interviews), we’d encourage the directors of his future projects to let him off the leash more often. The results are frequently dazzling. 16 / 17 1. (2017) 1. (2017) When filmmaker Paul King first sent the script to Hugh Grant, the character of Phoenix Buchanan, a “washed-up narcissistic old actor” (in Grant’s words), was called Hugh. Grant could have chosen to take that personally and refused to have anything to do with the project, but instead, he embraced it. The performance he gives in the film is one of his best and one of his most unhinged. In a quest to hunt down a hidden treasure using clues from a pop-up book in Paddington’s possession, he employs a series of eccentric disguises to trick the poor, innocent bear. If Grant didn’t have a blast making the film, he did a fine job of making it look as though he did. 17 / 17",

        "content": "The Biden administration is investing billions in passenger rail, giving a boost to a potentially important tool for mitigating climate change. However, significant hurdles could slow efforts to get more rail online. Last week, President Biden in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding for 10 passenger rail projects, including what the White House described as the “first world-class high-speed rail projects in our country’s history.” The funded projects include a line connecting California to Las Vegas — which alone is expected to carry 11 million passengers each year and prevent 400,000 tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere — as well as lines serving California’s Central Valley, North Carolina and a line connecting Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Va. Experts, the rail industry and environmentalists say that passenger trains could be an important tool for getting people out of cars and planes, thereby helping the planet. “As long as it helps get people from Point A to Point B, we will see less car trips on the road,” said Rebekah Whilden, deputy director of Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All campaign. She added that a reduction in travel in personal vehicles is “ultimately what we need to see to see the emissions reductions that we need.” Nick Little, director of railway education at Michigan State University’s Center For Railway Research and Education, said there is potential to grow more rail in the U.S., but only in “selective” locations. He said that opportunities exist in the northeastern U.S., as well as to connect the Dallas-Fort Worth area to Houston and Austin in Texas and Chicago to cities including Detroit, Grand Rapids, Mich., and Minneapolis. However, the future of rail may not look like the ambitious high-speed rail maps that , illustrating fantasies of connecting the entire nation: Such ideas are a “pipe dream,” Little said. The U.S. Department of Transportation has its for passenger trains. It identifies parts of the Northeast and California as places for “frequent trains at 125-250+ mph in the nation’s densest and most populous regions” and parts of the Midwest as areas for regional service connecting large and midsize cities as well as “feeder” services to connect communities to the rail network. Christopher Barkan, professor and director of the Rail Transportation and Engineering Center at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said that he expects rail to grow in the years ahead, noting that there’s already significant work underway. He said he mostly expects it to crop up in corridors between 100 and 400 miles in length. “It’s a combination of population density and suitable distances where both conventional and high-speed passenger [rail] can be competitive,” Barkan said. Andy Kunz, president of the U.S. High Speed Rail Association, said “the prognosis is really good” for the future of high-speed rail. “The really good thing is, the Brightline West one, which will connect Las Vegas and Los Angeles, that one will be up and running in four short years,” Kurz said. “It’ll make the case much sooner to the American people how great of a transportation mode this actually is,” he added, saying that another California project is expected to take longer to build. However, he said that building out high-speed rail in the Northeast is “going to be one of the harder ones to build because they’ll have to build a whole new set of tracks” in order to handle the high speeds. Meanwhile, Little said that he particularly expects to see more frequent trains on existing routes going forward because it’s “an easy thing to do, relatively,” since the trains themselves are the only additional expense. But for new rail, there are still hurdles to overcome. Barkan said the nation’s environmental review process — sometimes known as permitting — is one hurdle. “The initial thing that takes time is the environmental permitting,” he said. “That’s actually one of the things I think the United States needs to improve is to accelerate its environmental permitting process for projects such as this.” Permitting is also a hot topic on Capitol Hill — where lawmakers have sought to make a deal to speed up energy and other infrastructure projects. As part of a deal to lift the debt ceiling, some changes such as shorter federal environmental reviews were approved earlier this year, but lawmakers do not appear to have moved closer on a broader agreement. Kunz said that not having enough funding for rail projects is the “No. 1 reason” for delays. “Not having the money readily available early, the project ends up slowing down or actually stopping and waiting for the money to come in,” he said. This, in turn, drives up the bill for projects because of inflation and increased costs. Barkan said the grants announced last week will be “a significant help,” but more is needed. “We’re not done yet, but it’s a huge step forward.” Whilden, with the Sierra Club, said the nation’s rail system might be able to get a boost not only from money allocated by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, but also through more in the Inflation Reduction Act. “Municipalities and states can apply for it, and basically the only kind of checkbox is that it has to lower … pollution emissions, and so rail could be seen as being able to be used for that sort of grant,” Whilden said.",

        "content": "December 15, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread by Paula RAMON Jaguars don't understand borders, but where the United States meets Mexico, they are having to adapt to them. Once the master of the Sonoran Desert, the animal is now struggling to survive in a landscape cut in two by a wall. The barrier, which former US president Donald Trump boasted he would make \"impenetrable,\" does little to discourage the thousands of people from Latin America, Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe who arrive in the country every day, fleeing poverty and persecution. But, say conservationists, the fencing erected by successive administrations in Washington is deadly to wildlife. \"One of the most important things for the health of ecosystems is habitat connectivity ,\" says Laiken Jordahl from the Center for Biological Diversity. \"Animals need to be able to roam, to find food, water, to find mates. Having wide expanses of connected landscape is critical.\" A metal fence rises 30 feet (9 meters) at the southern edge of the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, a 117,000-acre (47,000-hectare) home for threatened and endangered plants and animals in Arizona. The barrier marks the end of the United States, but not the end of the habitat for dozens of species, including American antelope, mule deer, lynx, mountain lions and jaguars. \"This wall is clearly going to sever this entire ecosystem from all of the wild lands in Mexico that will make animals on this side and that side of the wall more vulnerable to drought, to climate change , to inbreeding,\" Jordahl said. Scientists think there are about 150 jaguars on the Mexican side; there have been only seven documented sightings on the American side in recent decades. \"One individual jaguar can roam hundreds or thousands of acres, they can walk hundreds of miles in a matter of days. They need massive landscapes available to them,\" said Jordahl. \"Jaguars are coming up to Arizona from Sonora in Mexico, but a lot of them are being met with a solid border wall.\" 'Undercutting' A physical barrier at the US-Mexico border has been in the works for decades along stretches of the 2,000-mile (3,000-kilometer) frontier. It is present in national parks , nature reserves and on indigenous lands in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California, ending a few yards (meters) out into the Pacific Ocean. Each piece of the jigsaw reveals the administration that put it there—Trump's section of wall, for example, stands the highest, a reflection of the Republican's signature pledge to shutter the border. Trump's White House repealed or circumvented rules designed to lessen environmental impacts, causing \"irreparable\" damage in nature reserves and on indigenous lands, according to a report released in September by the Government Accountability Office, the auditing arm of Congress. Democrat Joe Biden halted the expansion of the wall when he came to office in 2021, but in October his administration authorized the closing of some gaps, mainly in Arizona. For Jordahl, the rush to erect the barrier undermined years of careful conservation work by the government. \"The federal government has put hundreds of millions of dollars into protecting landscapes around the border, into recovering animals like the Mexican gray wolf and the jaguar. \"But at the same time, they're undercutting all of those goals by building this impermeable structure that stops... migrations dead in their tracks. \"Essentially, we're pulling thread after thread out of this patchwork that is the intact ecosystem,\" said Jordahl. \"It's only a matter of time until it all does start to unravel.\" © 2023 AFP",

That's the take-home message from CU Boulder hydrologist Shemin Ge, who will present a little-known piece of history from the river this Thursday at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting in San Francisco.",
        "content": "December 14, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by University of Colorado at Boulder When it comes to the Colorado River, history often repeats itself—but it doesn't have to. That's the take-home message from CU Boulder hydrologist Shemin Ge, who will present a little-known piece of history from the river this Thursday at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting in San Francisco. The story of hydrologist Eugene Clyde La Rue, Ge said, may help to explain the current water crisis facing many states in the American West. Ge's presentation centers around a decision made in 1922 when the seven men who made up the Colorado River Commission came to an agreement to divvy up water on the Colorado River. This waterway winds over 1,450 miles and through seven states. The commission relied on an estimate from the U.S. Reclamation Service suggesting that 16.4 million acre-feet of water ran through the river at Lees Ferry, Arizona, every year. (An acre-foot equals the amount of water you'd need to submerge an acre of land to a depth of 1 foot). But, Ge said, the commission also failed to consider a second, less convenient study from 1916. Relying on his own field data, La Rue, working for the U.S. Geological Survey, had calculated that the Colorado River discharged just 15 million acre-feet of water . \"It's intriguing how such good work at the time was ignored, whether it was intentional or just out of ignorance,\" said Ge, professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at CU Boulder. She worries it may be happening again. In 2022, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, the two main reservoirs on the Colorado River, dried up to levels never seen before, raising concerns that they could be heading for a \"dead pool\" state—in which water could flow in but not out of the reservoirs. Currently, the seven states within the Colorado River Compact are working to revise a suite of agreements and guidelines by 2026. Ge hopes that this time, leaders will work closely with scientists and a range of community members, particularly Indigenous groups—all to build a Law of the River that accounts for how much water actually exists in the West, now and in the future. That will become more important, she said, as climate change continues to melt the West's dwindling snowpacks. \"There's so much we can learn from history to improve how we're managing our water,\" Ge said. \"Right now, I don't think we're doing enough.\" She first learned about La Rue's story from the 2019 book, \" Science Be Dammed \" by Eric Kuhn and John Fleck. She and her colleagues wrote about their insights this summer in the magazine \"Eos.\" Think of it as a tale of two estimates. Beginning in 1914, La Rue hiked across much of the river and its tributaries, collecting first-hand data on the flow of water. That included taking measurements of the depth of the river and its flow speed. \"We still do this in our Intro to Geology courses,\" Ge said. \"It's very low-tech, but elegant.\" To come to its 16.4 million acre-feet assessment, in contrast, the Colorado River Commission, led by Secretary of Commerce and future President Herbert Hoover, relied on a much less rigorous study: measurements taken at just one site near Yuma, Arizona, hundreds of miles south of Lees Ferry. \"They took the larger number,\" Ge said. \"A larger number probably made the allocations easier to negotiate because there was more water to divvy up.\" The 40 million people who depend on the Colorado River for their water today may be paying the price. Today, research pegs the flow of the Colorado River at around 13 million acre-feet per year, making even La Rue's modest estimates seem like a fantasy. The Colorado River Compact, however, continues to allot water based on the 16.4 million acre-feet value: Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming together claim 7.5 million acre-feet. Arizona, California, and Nevada get the same, and Mexico supposedly draws 1.4 million. Ge hopes that, in the lead-up to 2026, those seven states will do what Hoover couldn't—draw on the best available science to develop realistic estimates of how much water will likely flow down the river decades from now. She added that Indigenous groups need to be an important part of that process. Several tribes hold some of the most senior rights to water in the western U.S. but lack the infrastructure to access much of their share. \"We're not talking enough about how much water is in the Colorado River,\" Ge said. \"We talk about droughts, infrastructure, and water conservation. But shouldn't the first order of business be to see how much water we actually have? It's much less than we think.\" More information: Abstract: Learning from history in reallocating the Colorado River Provided by University of Colorado at Boulder",

        "content": "Earlier this week, I went to TGI Fridays for the very first time. I wasn’t there to eat ironically, lambaste the food, or disparage the place outright. Rather, there was something that brought me to TGIF specifically, and it’s the financial data suggesting chain restaurants are once again on the rise. I’ve read the op-eds and essays. , says Eater citing figures that show ’s sales are up, as are . Texas Roadhouse is the in the world, and many fast-casual are trending upward as well. I’m fascinated by this surge in mid-tier chain restaurant dining. Eater puts it this way: Getting good food at a reasonable price isn’t all that easy here in Los Angeles. It’s why eating out for me these days usually involves burritos, , tacos, and . But a sit-down affair? A few drinks and some appetizers? That puts you north of $40 . Hell, finding a mixed drink under $13 is a near impossibility in this sun-soaked city. Still, it’s not necessarily a binary, where your only choices are potato skins or steak au poivre. But Fridays would love for you to see it that way. , it seems like the restaurant wants to showcase its value first and foremost. I wanted to see if that translated to a good meal. I went to Fridays with a friend, chef , around 2 p.m. on a Monday. This particular Fridays is —a giant dining area with a wrap-around bar easily seating 20 people, and plenty of TVs. Fridays is ready to accommodate large parties, throngs of happy hour attendees, and groups of bros eager to watch sporting events. Two o’clock is an odd time to eat and drink, but it’s also the most stress-free time to go to any restaurant. The emptiness was comforting, but the physical space of Fridays is where the words “empty” and “comfort” stop finding common ground. The prices at Fridays are, at face value, mind-blowingly good: $3.79 for truffle tot-chos, chips and jalapeño ranch for $3, mozzarella sticks for $5.59, and buffalo chicken slammers for $5.99, to name a few. The chain has a huge menu, full of subsections like small plates, appetizers, shareables, entrées, burgers and sandwiches, wings, salads, soups, bowls, a sushi and Asian-inspired section called Krispy Rice, and an expansive drink menu. Previously, I had thought that “small plates,” “appetizers,” and “shareables” were all words used interchangeably, but at Fridays, the menu clarifies the distinctions: Small plates serve 1 person, appetizers serve 2-3, and shareables serve 4-6. The clear, recommended feeding portions is refreshing. You don’t have to worry about over- or under-ordering. Despite the wealth of options, I have always assumed that Fridays is all about appetizers, and the best thing I ate was surely the mozzarella sticks. Though the cheese itself tasted barely of anything, the low-moisture mozzarella pull was absolutely delightful. Look how happy the pull made me. This is what food is supposed to do. The mozzarella sticks were the highlight, however, because most of the food just didn’t taste like it’s supposed to. The meatballs tasted remarkably unlike beef. I have never tasted meat that tastes less like meat in my life. This isn’t some gate-keeping review of TGI Fridays, but yes, words like “rubbery,” “bland,” and “greasy” come to mind. The two tiny meatballs cost $4.99. That’s not a good deal. The truffle tot-chos were crunchy and fun, but also absolutely fumigated with truffle oil. They smell toxic—these little croquettes should come with a gas mask. Is that harsh? Pretentious? Maybe, but look pal, I’m not the one using truffle oil here. Fridays’ use of truffle oil reminds me of the first time my nephew called me a shithead. It was funny once, and yes, my own behaviors taught you to do this, but knock it off right now, man. What’s a buffalo chicken slammer? Essentially, it’s a fried chicken tender stuffed into a mini lobster roll bun. This is a really fun idea, and the type of thing that would have been delicious if executed well. But the slammers were a disappointment because the presentation suggested the promise of delicious, fucked-up whimsy. Instead, they were just bland, and again, the price for portion wasn’t that great here. You know what else I can get for $6? Two amazing al pastor tacos, or one of the best slices of in the city. The one saving grace at Fridays was the booze. I ordered an espresso martini, which was so intensely sugary it tasted like it was intended for children. Still, it’s not the worst espresso martini I’ve had by a long shot, and for $10, it’s a damn good deal. Drinks at Fridays are cheap, which is great, because you should be very drunk there. All of the food I ate at Fridays was unseasoned, taste-avoidant, and unsatisfying. These harsh criticisms raise questions within myself. Am I an asshole for wanting the food to be better? When did I suddenly set a high bar for Fridays? I reckon the moment I walked through the door. Whether it’s a chain or not, there exist certain expectations for restaurant-quality food the moment you sit down to enjoy a meal, and that’s true no matter what type of establishment it is. I’ve been searching for some sort of profound thing to say after eating at Fridays, some sort of meaning to glean from the experience itself, and I think it’s this: It’s totally fine to like things, but it’s also okay to hate things. It’s okay to hate a restaurant’s food as long as that hate comes from a place of actually wanting to improve it. I don’t begrudge anybody for enjoying Fridays, and I have no interest in dunking on it for sport. But I do want everyone to have their fair share of seasoning. Affordable, flavorful food should be an option for everybody. To accept that it only exists when corporate dining overlords decide it’s comfortably within their margins is less than we deserve. Sometimes, you need a meal to wash down a meal. After Fridays, Lo and I went to , a celebrated taco truck a few miles away. What we received there wasn’t a bounty of photo-ready fried appetizers, but it was delicious, satisfying, expertly made, and cheap. Two shrimp tacos and six freshly shucked oysters cost $18. “There is a reason it’s loved in the community,” said Lo. People know they can go to Mariscos Jalisco for a reasonably priced meal, and they won’t even have to decode the difference between appetizers and shareables to get it.",

        "content": "Since the federal government took an “All the King’s horses and All the King’s men” approach to overcoming the 2022 infant formula shortage, it’s a little surprising that there is still something major to do about it. But there is. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is publishing a final rule to implement the so-called “Access to Baby Formula Act.” It was signed into law on May 21, 2022. The Formula Act was part of the months-long, whole-of-government response to the “recall-driven” infant formula shortages in 2022, The new law is supposed to provide access to the formula for WIC participants, even in unforeseen circumstances like disasters and emergencies, in addition to supply chain disruptions. FNS’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is the largest purchaser of infant formula in the United States. WIC’s market dominance, at the time when shortages became severe, contributed to the multi-billion dollar industry being controlled by just four companies that controlled 90 percent of the market. One of those four was Abbott Nutrition, which temporarily shut down out of concern for food safety. FNS claims to take its role in caring for families exceptionally seriously, including ensuring the people served by our programs, including WIC, have access to the safe, healthy foods they need to thrive. FNS also says it’s been working since the Access to Baby Formula Act was passed to implement the law as a final rule to strengthen and guide its response to any future baby formula-related challenges. This final rule will implement permanent, expanded authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to waive or modify specific legal requirements to help ensure the continuity of WIC services during emergencies and supply chain disruptions with an impact on WIC. It also adds requirements for WIC state agencies to include language in their WIC infant formula cost containment contracts that describe flexibilities available to WIC state agencies in case of an infant formula recall and how an infant formula manufacturer would protect against disruption of access to infant formula. Further, the final rule ensures that WIC state agencies anticipate and prepare for events that may disrupt normal program operations to reduce impacts on participants when an event does happen. The rule was scheduled to be published on Dec. 14 and will be open for public comment for 60 days, closing on Feb. 12. FNS is requesting comments on this rule through Feb. 12, 2024, to inform it of any future rules, policies, and guidance related to infant formula to ensure its best support of the WIC population regardless of what circumstances arise. The infant formula shortage lasted for months, leaving many parents on their own to find supply, sometimes across multiple states. Recalls for Cronobaqcter sakazakii illnesses associated with powdered infant formula contributed to the national shortage. The national shortage forced the Biden Administration to open its domestic formula market to the supply from imports. Almost no foreign formula was allowed into the U.S. previously.

        "content": "There are now 241 complaints from patrons of a sushi restaurant in Raleigh, NC, about foodborne illnesses. The complaints against Sushi Nine began Nov. 28, according to local health department officials. The suspected pathogen is norovirus, with at least three restaurant customers testing positive. The number of sick people is growing quickly with 100 more reporting becoming sick since the previous update on Dec, 9. Wake County Public Health and Wake County Environmental Services are investigating the outbreak. “Unfortunately, norovirus can spread very easily, especially during holiday gatherings and parties, which include a lot of meal prep and catering,” Wake County Public Health Director Rebecca Kaufman said. “We continue to work closely with customers who visited Sushi Nine, restaurant staff and our partners with NCDHHS (North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services) to determine the source and extent of the outbreak.” Owners of Sushi Nine closed the restaurant for two days for cleaning, but it has since reopened. About norovirus Symptoms of norovirus infection may include vomiting and/or diarrhea, nausea, muscle aches, fever, and headache, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms typically start 12 to 48 hours after exposure and can last for one to three days. Most people recover without treatment, however some may need medical attention for dehydration. People with norovirus infections can spread the infection easily to others. The virus can live on surfaces for long periods of time.

        "content": "More information has been shared by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) about Salmonella in poultry meat and eggs from Poland. There have been 200 cases of salmonellosis this year in the United Kingdom caused by different strains of Salmonella Enteritidis linked to such products. FSA has investigated more than 90 incidents in the past two years, with two outbreaks linked to eggs and three to poultry meat from Poland this year. The FSA, Food Standards Scotland (FSS), and the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) recently told consumers to take care when handling and cooking chicken, turkey, and duck products at home. Catering sites are using the majority of imported eggs. Repeated problems frustrate FSA Emily Miles, FSA chief executive, and Christine Middlemiss, chief veterinary officer, wrote a letter to the European Commission and the chief veterinary officer in Poland to flag the rise in cases involving Polish poultry and eggs. Information on the number of establishments involved was shared with Polish authorities. “Each time we have detected a specific food safety concern we have acted promptly to keep consumers safe, but we are unhappy about the repeated occurrences,” said Miles. An incident management group has been created to coordinate activities across government departments, including Defra and UKHSA, to move efforts from responding on a case-by-case basis to a more holistic approach. FSA said the Poland problem comes when it is experiencing an unexpected spike in other incidents and outbreaks. As part of the Border Target Operating Model (BTOM), pre-notifications would be required for EU commodities beginning at the end of January. Physical checks are planned beginning in April. However, it is possible to use existing regulations to do additional controls earlier if necessary. The British Poultry Council (BPC) wants to see authorities checking every load from Poland and rejecting those not meeting requirements. Richard Griffiths, BPC chief executive, said: “We have long established and rigorous processes to deal with Salmonella, and we follow these to the letter to produce food people trust and value. It is disappointing that Poland cannot do the same and is willing to export its hygiene problems instead of dealing with them.” The UK Office for Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Trade Assurance is undertaking an audit of Poland in April 2024 to evaluate the controls in place. In November, the UK hosted the annual Trade Specialised Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures under the EU/UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement. FSA requested discussions on improving cooperation and information sharing on food safety incidents. Talks are expected to be held in early 2024. E. coli outbreak due to animal contact Meanwhile, the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) was part of a team investigating a Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) human outbreak that was epidemiologically linked to an animal-contact visitor attraction. In a report covering activities from July to September, the agency said STEC O157 and STEC O26 were behind the outbreak. Environmental sampling at the premises detected STEC O26 in a children’s play area; other areas were also positive for STEC. E. coli was confirmed in all 32 samples of animal feces taken. Although some STECs were detected, they were not O157 or O26. The site closed voluntarily after being told of human illnesses. Local authority and APHA visits identified deficiencies in compliance with the relevant industry code of practice. The most common issues at animal contact attractions include suboptimal handwashing facilities, poor supervision of animal contact, contamination of walkways with soiled animal bedding or feces, and unclear marking of animal contact versus non-contact areas. Work at the premises to rectify deficiencies improved the situation before a phased reopening. APHA also said there were no cryptosporidiosis investigations during the third quarter of 2023.

        "content": "Food safety was either the top or the second most important thing when buying food for people in Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Kosovo. In Kosovo, 57 percent said food safety was the main factor, with cost being second. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, cost was first with 64 percent, followed by food safety with 54 percent. It is the first Eurobarometer food safety poll to include people’s views in Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Kosovo. Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Turkey also took part in the survey, commissioned by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), in 2019. These seven countries are aiming to join the EU at some point in the future. Bosnia and Herzegovina findings The survey in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo was carried out between May and June 2023, with more than 2,000 respondents from different social and demographic groups being interviewed face-to-face in their language. Overall, 69 percent of respondents in Bosnia and Herzegovina said they were personally interested in food safety, compared to the EU average of 70 percent. People had mainly heard about additives like colors, preservatives, or flavorings used in food or drinks and food poisoning from items contaminated by bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The latter was also a major concern of citizens, alongside genetically modified ingredients. The top reason given not to engage with food safety was “I know enough to avoid or mitigate food risks.” Barbara Gallani, head of EFSA’s communications and partnership department, said: “Together with our partners in EU member states and in pre-accession countries our cooperation on communication has benefitted from generating insights from social research like the Eurobarometer. “We can better understand the concerns and needs of audiences to help make our communications more impactful. This collaboration is already bearing fruit for use in campaigns we run jointly and as input for our national partners when they need to communicate directly with their citizens.” Kosovo results A total of 78 percent of respondents in Kosovo said they were interested in the topic of food safety, which was above the EU average. Participants mainly had heard and were concerned about food poisoning from items contaminated by bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Reasons not to engage with food safety were split between taking it for granted food was safe, knowing enough to avoid or mitigate risks, and finding food safety information highly technical and complex. A recent assessment of food safety control systems by the European Commission found Bosnia and Herzegovina had a way to go to meet EU standards. While Kosovo had made progress, the country’s food agency needed more financial and human resources. EFSA is also running a tender process to help pre-accession countries build capacities to address future food-related crises. These nations include Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo , Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey. One of the objectives is to develop annual training plans and materials, covering two-day workshops in 2024, 2025, and 2026 with different training formats such as case studies, desktop exercises, and mock exercises, plus a simulation covering an urgent response to a multi-country animal or public health outbreak related to biological hazards, animal health and welfare, plant health, and chemical hazards. Expected outcomes of the training are enhanced urgent response capacities in risk assessment and risk communication and improved crisis preparedness procedures. The tender process is open until Jan. 2, 2024. (To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here .)",

The new year is the perfect time to declutter, streamline, and organize your space so that you can tackle all the other goals you have for 2024. If you want some help to get started, look no further: we've got the 12 golden rules of decluttering all laid out for you below. 1. Get rid of duplicates If you have duplicates lying around, get rid of them if they are not necessary. Keep the better duplicate and trash or donate the other. 2. Get rid of things you haven't used in a year So you keep telling yourself that you'll use it eventually. But if you haven't touched it in a year, chances are that you're not going to in the near future. Do your home a favor and get rid of the items that aren't getting any use. 3. Digitize nostalgic items Do you have too many nostalgic items that you can't seem to get yourself to give away? Take photos of them and then get rid of them - you'll be able to keep them around forever without cluttering up your space. 4. Don't keep items out of guilt I'm sure you have a thing or two around the house that you keep out of guilt. Perhaps it's a sweater sweet aunt Betty knitted for you for Christmas that you never wear or that fancy dress you splurged way too much on. Time to be brutal and get rid of them all. 5. Put things back where they belong It's easy to just leave things lying around, but that's how clutter builds up. After you're done using something, immediately put it back where it belongs so you won't procrastinate. 6. And find a home for them Make sure every item in your home has a place, whether it's a plastic container or an under-the-bed organizer. And remember: a pile of items is not a true place for your things. 7. Sell, give away, donate, upcycle, or throw away When assessing things you want to get rid of, start by seeing if you can make some of your money back by selling it. If you don't think it's worth the effort to sell, give it away to people you know who will use it. Perhaps to your family and friends, or even your Facebook network. You can also choose to donate it to get a tax write-off. 8. Don't keep items you wouldn't buy now Are there some items you have that you would never buy now? Perhaps you should take a good hard look at them and figure out why you need them now and if you can do without them. 9. Opt for covered furniture If you have a clutter problem, choose furniture that is covered, such as a closet with a sliding door instead of open shelves. This will help your place look cleaner and more organized. 10. Don't forget storage under your bed There's a lot of real estate in your home that's not being put to good use; one that people often forget about is under-the-bed storage. 11. Think tall Use up all the space in your home to make the most of it, including the vertical space. The more space you have for your stuff, the less likely it's going to get cluttered up. 12. Evaluate your spending If you're buying things you don't need, take a hard look at your spending. Perhaps you need to take part in a 30-day spending hiatus to motivate yourself.

        "content": "Retailer lists are now available for peaches, nectarines and plums linked to a Listeria outbreak that has killed one person and sickened others. Samples from sick people were collected from Aug. 22, 2018, to Aug. 16, this year. The outbreak is considered ongoing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The sick people are spread across seven states and all of them have required hospitalization. Whole genome sequencing has allowed public health officials to match patients across several years, all with the outbreak strait of Listeria monocytogenes. The Food and Drug Administration has also found the pathogen on samples of peaches from the producer. Anyone who ate recalled peaches, plums or nectarines in recently should monitor themselves for seven weeks after eating the fruit for signs of Listeria infection. Symptoms are listed below. The FDA continues to work to find out what retailers may have received recalled fruit associated with this outbreak. The agency has released a list of retailers and the states where the recalled fruit has been distributed. The fruit is past its sell-by date, but there is concern that consumers may have frozen some of it for future use. The recalled fruit was distributed to the following stores and states: In response to this investigation, HMC Farms has voluntarily recalled all of its peaches, plums, and nectarines sold in retail stores from May 1, 2022, through Nov. 15, 2022, and from May 1, 2023, through Nov. 15, 2023. The recalled fruit was sold at retail stores as individual pieces of fruit bearing PLU stickers or in consumer packaging; however, the recalled fruit is no longer available for sale and any previously purchased fruit should be past shelf life. If you previously purchased recalled fresh peaches, plums and nectarines and then froze them, you should throw them away if they are part of the recall or if you cannot tell if they are part of the recall. Fresh whole peaches, plums, and nectarines currently available for sale at retail are not included in this recall. About Listeria infections Food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections. Anyone who has eaten any of the recalledfruitand developed symptoms of Listeria infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible Listeria exposure. Also, anyone who has eaten any of the recalled products should monitor themselves for symptoms during the coming weeks because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to Listeria for symptoms of listeriosis to develop. Symptoms of Listeria infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache, and neck stiffness. Specific laboratory tests are required to diagnose Listeria infections, which can mimic other illnesses. Pregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people such as cancer patients who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections, and other complications. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or even stillbirth.

        "content": "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) knew that America’s meat industry had a drug problem. For decades, evidence had amassed that the widespread use of antibiotics to make livestock grow faster — and survive the crowded, unsanitary conditions of factory farms — was causing bacteria to mutate and develop resistance to antibiotics used in human medicine. Over time, once easily treatable human infections, such as urinary tract infections and tuberculosis, became to treat. A foundational component of modern medicine was starting to crumble. But it wasn’t until the mid-2010s that the FDA finally took the basic steps of requiring farmers to get veterinary prescriptions for antibiotics and banning the use of antibiotics to make animals grow faster — steps that some European regulators had taken a decade or more prior. Thanks to those two actions alone, sales of medically important antibiotics for livestock plummeted 42 percent from 2015 to 2017. But in a concerning course reversal, antibiotic sales for use in livestock have ticked back up, increasing 12 percent from 2017 to 2022, per a new . Sales increased 4 percent in 2022 alone. In 2022, the chicken industry’s antibiotics purchasing slightly declined, but in every other major sector — cattle, pork, and turkey — antibiotic sales rose. “Antibiotic sales to meat producers continue to increase despite efforts that the FDA has made,” Louis Sokolow, a policy associate with Frontier Group, a public health and sustainability research organization, told Vox. “The status quo of these small increases year over year is not enough to protect people from antibiotic-resistant bacteria.” According to an published in September by the Natural Resources Defense Council and One Health Trust, medically important antibiotics are increasingly going to livestock instead of humans. In 2017, the meat industry purchased 62 percent of the US supply. By 2020, it rose to 69 percent. It’s a sobering turn of events with life-and-death implications. In 2019, antibiotic-resistant bacteria directly killed over globally, including , and more than 5 million others across the world died from diseases where antibiotic resistance played a role — far more than the global toll of HIV/AIDS or malaria, leading the World Health Organization to antibiotic resistance “one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today.” Public health advocates want to see the FDA take the threat much more seriously, and often point to Europe as a . From 2011 to 2022, antibiotic sales for use in livestock fell across the European Union, and use per animal is now that of the US. Last year, the EU implemented perhaps its most significant reform yet: banning the routine use of antibiotics to prevent disease, reserving their use for only when animals are actually sick. It’s unlikely the FDA will follow in Europe’s footsteps any time soon. Asked about an EU-style ban on preventive use of antibiotics, an FDA spokesperson responded, “The laws in the US and our livestock population are not the same as that of the EU or other countries. The FDA’s initiatives to promote judicious use and reduce AMR [antimicrobial resistance] were devised specifically for the US and the conditions we face with the aim of maximizing effectiveness and cooperation of drug sponsors, veterinarians, and animal producers.” The FDA and the US food industry have proven that they can make progress on the issue — but to keep antibiotics working, they need to do a lot more. That will require them to tackle beef and pork, two of the more stubborn and complex sectors of America’s meat system that just can’t seem to quit antibiotics, since doing so could demand substantive changes to how animals are farmed for food. The American antibiotic-free revolution that wasn’t It wasn’t just the FDA’s new rules that caused antibiotic sales for livestock to plunge in a two-year period — Big Chicken played a part too. In the early 2000s, the nation’s fourth-largest chicken producer began efforts to wean its birds off antibiotics, which it achieved in 2016 by changing chickens’ diets and replacing antibiotics with vaccines and probiotics. At first, chicken raised without antibiotics cost 50 percent more, but the company says it has since been able to all but close the cost differential. In the mid-2010s, while Perdue was making progress, activists leveraged the momentum and McDonald’s to source chicken raised without medically important antibiotics which contributed to a domino effect in which producers and restaurants made further pledges to reduce antibiotics in poultry. By 2020, a little of America’s 9 billion chickens farmed for meat were raised without antibiotics, according to an . The sea change in chicken production demonstrated it was possible to quickly scale down antibiotics in farming, but it didn’t do much to reduce overall use, as the chicken industry only used 6 percent of antibiotics in agriculture in 2016. And the momentum didn’t spread to other parts of the meat business, like beef and pork, which together account for over of medically important antibiotics fed to farmed animals. Some of the lack of progress in beef and pork comes down to the simple fact that pigs and cattle are raised differently than chickens. Chickens are slaughtered at just six or seven weeks old, so the chance they’ll get sick is lower than pigs, who are slaughtered at six months old, or cattle, slaughtered at around three years of age. The chicken industry is also vertically integrated, meaning a company like Tyson or Perdue controls virtually every link in the supply chain, so making big changes like cutting out antibiotics is easier than in the more decentralized supply chain of beef. For example, the typical steer will change hands several times before slaughter, going from a breeder to pasture grazing to a feedlot, all of which make it harder to coordinate an antibiotic-free regimen. In the last few months of their life cattle are also fed a high-grain diet that they aren’t adapted to digest, which increases the chance they’ll develop a , a condition that’s prevented with antibiotics. The pork sector, like poultry, is also vertically integrated, but the industry has largely opposed , , and reforms. Antibiotics in pig production shot up from 2017 to 2022. There’s also no pork or beef giant that’s taken the antibiotic-free leap like Perdue did for chicken. That could change in the years ahead: McDonald’s, the world’s largest beef purchaser, at the end of 2022 that it plans to reduce antibiotic use in its beef supply chain. However, the announcement didn’t come with a timeline, which . Although voluntary change can move the needle, without regulation, industry has little incentive to make the dramatic reductions needed to safeguard antibiotics. While the FDA has prohibited meat producers from using antibiotics to speed up growth— their in agriculture — some of the that , like tylosin, are still allowed for disease prevention. Matthew Wellington, formerly of the Public Interest Research Group, or PIRG, told Vox this is a that disincentivizes producers from reducing antibiotics: “Our concern has always been that they’re just putting a different name on the same kind of use, which is a problem.” (This story was originally published in January 2023; Wellington has since left PIRG). In response to this concern, an FDA spokesperson said, “Veterinarians are on the front lines and as prescribers, they’re in the best position to ensure that both medically important and non-medically important antimicrobials are being used appropriately.” Aside from outright banning the routine use of medically important antibiotics to prevent disease, PIRG would like to see the FDA take three actions: set a target of reducing antibiotic use by 50 percent by the end of 2025 (based on 2010 levels); publish data on antibiotic use, not just sales; and limit the duration of antibiotic courses for farmed animals. An FDA spokesperson said specific reduction targets weren’t possible because the agency doesn’t know how many antibiotics farmers are using: “We cannot effectively monitor antimicrobial use without first putting a system in place for determining [a] baseline and assessing trends over time.” The agency right now only collects sales data, and it’s been exploring a to collect and report real-world use data. Some states haven’t waited on federal regulators: have both restricted the use of antibiotics on farms. How the Europeans — and some Americans — are quitting antibiotics on the farm Just because it’s difficult to reduce antibiotics in beef and pork production doesn’t mean it’s impossible, as the story of Iowa pig farmers Tim and Deleana Roseland demonstrates. In 2005, they switched from raising pigs in the conventional manner — tightly cramped and fed a steady diet of antibiotics — to raising pigs for Niman Ranch, a higher-welfare meat company now owned by Perdue. That required the Roselands to ditch the routine use of antibiotics. “I was nervous about it at first but as it turned out, it was no big deal whatsoever,” Tim Roseland said. But he added that it wouldn’t have been possible with his old setup: “There’s too much overcrowding, small pens, too many pigs crammed into a little area.” Their newer system gives each pig more space in larger pens, and bedding that they root through and chew on, instead of, when they’re packed into factory farms, chewing on each other. They also give the pigs more vaccines and feed them probiotics. And there’s a lot to learn from Denmark, Europe’s pork producer. From 1992 to 2008, antibiotic use per pig fell by over 50 percent, and while pig mortality went up in the short term, by 2008 it had dropped back to near-1992 levels. The small country’s transformation wasn’t a matter of rocket science, but a suite of smart : more frequent barn cleaning, better ventilation, later piglet weaning, more space per pig, , and experimenting with feed and additives. All this comes with difficult tradeoffs: antibiotic-free pork costs more and requires more land, which increases its carbon footprint. But we can’t expect to have cheap meat forever without a cost to public health, an uncomfortable truth that’s led many environmental and public health groups to champion a message of meat. “I think the fact that Denmark, despite very low antibiotic use since 1995, is still one of the biggest pork exporters in the world, already speaks for itself,” said Francesca Chiara, a director at the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. Given the of global antibiotic sales for agriculture, Denmark’s example may not be speaking loudly enough. But it’s time we listen — nothing less than the future of human medicine is at stake.",

        "content": "Sometimes when I’m looking out across the northern meadow of Brooklyn’s Prospect Park, or even the concrete parking lot outside my office window, I wonder if someone like Shakespeare or Emily Dickinson could have taken in the same view and seen I don’t mean making out blurry details or more objects in the scene. But through the lens of their minds, could they encounter the exact same world as me and yet have a richer experience? One way to answer that question, at least as a thought experiment, could be to compare the electrical activity inside our brains while gazing out upon the same scene, and running some statistical analysis designed to actually tell us whose brain activity indicates more richness. But that’s just a loopy thought experiment, right? Not exactly. One of the newest frontiers in the science of the mind is the consciousness’s “complexity,” or how diverse and integrated electrical activity is across the brain. Philosophers and neuroscientists alike that more complex brain activity signifies “richer” experiences. The idea of measuring complexity stems from — a mathematical approach to understanding how information is stored, communicated, and processed —which doesn’t provide wonderfully intuitive examples of what more richness actually means. Unless you’re a computer person. “If you tried to upload the content onto a hard drive, it’s how much memory you’d need to be able to store the experience you’re having,” , a professor of machine learning and data science at the University of Sussex, told me. Another approach to understanding richness is to look at how it changes in different mental states. Recent studies have found that are lowest in patients under general anesthesia, higher in ordinary wakefulness, and higher still in psychedelic trips, which can notoriously turn even the most mundane experiences — say, my view of the parking lot outside my office window — into . Increasing richness isn’t just like cranking up the color saturation of a picture or getting a bigger hard drive. It seems to imply an increase in the depth of how we experience the world. Complexity is what you see in the equations, richness is what that feels like in the mind. Although measuring brain complexity is still in relative infancy, the nascent ability to gauge something like richness is a pretty incredible development — not only for but for how we think about well-being more broadly. With innovations like these, we can go beyond the , which doesn’t have an accepted neurological measure that can translate across social and cultural differences, and ask more targeted questions, like whether our experiences are richer. As these approaches mature, scientists might develop a deeper understanding of all the different, tractable ways that consciousness can change for the better. From staining neurons black to measuring the brain’s complexity In the 1800s, scientists studying the mind didn’t yet know what a neuron looked like, let alone how they worked. That breakthrough came in , when physician Camillo Golgi discovered that by immersing brain tissue in a potassium dichromate solution and then dunking it in a bath of silver nitrate, the neuron would turn black, making it visible under a microscope. The Spanish neuroscientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, when observing newly stained neural tissue in 1887, discovered that contrary to the reigning reticular theory (which held that the nervous system was a continuous network of cells smushed together with no gaps), neurons were indeed separated from each other. Sprouting from the neuron’s edges were spindly little axons and dendrites, but they didn’t seem to create permanent bridges between the neurons, leading him to conclude that communication between neurons likely wasn’t all that important in explaining their main functions. Instead, individual neurons were taken as the nervous system’s fundamental units, or building blocks, an idea that solidified into “the .” Through the 20th century, developments in electrophysiology led to a sharper understanding of the connections between neurons, and the importance of the little electrical impulses that travel across synapses. But the basic perspective of focusing on neurons themselves, rather than the holistic electrical processes that they’re conduits for, remained dominant. This approach has gotten quite good at breaking the brain into distinct parts and explaining how they contribute to specific functions, like vision or controlling your fingers. The downside is that many theories of consciousness struggle with what’s called the — the question of how all the separate parts fit back together to generate a unified conscious experience. Recent improvements to electroencephalography (EEG, those skull caps with a bunch of electrodes that measure the brain’s electrical activity) made it possible to look deeper inside the workings of the brain, opening the way for neuroscientist Giulio Tononi and biologist Gerald Edelman’s 1998 paper: . Their publication was the first to propose a direct measure of the complexity of brain activity, an idea that matured into , or IIT. According to IIT, consciousness arises where the underlying neural activity is both “integrated” and “differentiated.” Integration refers, roughly, to how synchronized electrical activity is across the brain. Differentiation is the diversity of that activity. You can think of them in terms of weaving a tapestry. Integration is how many different threads are woven in, while differentiation is the variety of colors used. Together, these two determine the complexity of a given state of consciousness. That, in turn, approximates its richness. In theory, anyway. At the time, the idea ran ahead of technology. “It became apparent over the years that it’s quite hard to measure those two things simultaneously,” Barrett told me, “and it turned out that the differentiation aspect alone, without thinking about integration, did quite well at being able to distinguish between different states of consciousness.” That said, our measures are improving quickly. Barrett co-authored released as a pre-print last week that compared a new measure of complexity — what they call “statistical complexity” — to Lempel-Ziv complexity, which was first in 1976 and is still the field’s leading measure. While Lempel-Ziv captures only the differentiation aspect, their findings suggest that the new measure successfully brings integration back into the mix, affording greater precision. As progress continues, IIT may creep closer to its grand ambition: constructing an equation that can measure and describe the richness of conscious experience in any physical system, whether human, animal, or machine. “That fails at the moment,” said Barrett, “but I’m very interested in seeing if we could come up with a plausible equation. That’s sort of the holy grail for me.” So what do we make of richness? If a plausible equation isn’t the kind of thing that occupies your dreams, a concrete measure for something like richness could bring some sorely needed innovation to our ideas around . The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (the DSM-5) contains diagnoses to help clinicians classify just about every shade of mental disorder they might encounter. When it comes to the positive dimensions of mental health, however, our language is comparatively sparse. “Happiness” is a very nebulous idea, especially when you . We in the West, unlike the Buddhists, have not developed rigorous taxonomies for all the rungs on the mental ladder — from our default modes to the ecstasies, grades of zest, or senses of “ ” that lurk in the (reportedly, anyway). If we can quantify the richness of our minds, maybe it could jumpstart the process of finding other tractable dimensions we can add to our conceptions of well-being. Of course, quantifying something important always (à la : when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure), and being wise about how to make sense of these new ideas will be bumpy. It’s tempting, for example, to simply think that when it comes to richness, more is always better. But researchers, like 50 honoree , believe that the brain evolved to hold levels of complexity below a threshold called “criticality,” rather than just maximize it. In information theory, criticality marks the optimal balance of complexity for processing information, a perch between order and chaos. Or in terms of the mind, between the rigidity and flexibility of mental habits. Too much complex activity pushes the brain over the edge. That might offer a temporarily exciting state of mind (as psychedelic trips can), but in terms of efficiently processing information to be successful creatures in the world, a never-ending acid trip is probably not the ideal state. “A brain at criticality may be a ‘happier’ brain,” Carhart-Harris . If criticality means greater well-being calls for a particular balance of complexity, not just as much as we can muster, that doesn’t mean that we’re all, by default, naturally tuned to that balance. As our measures and technologies improve, maybe we’ll get better at identifying when someone’s ordinary brain activity is below criticality, and a burst of complexity could serve as a boon to well-being. Maybe we’ll develop new ways of growing richer, not just in our bank accounts (though that may help), but in the ways that we experience the world.",

She simultaneously experienced several sensations: numbness coupled with prickly, tingling pain.

Chronic Hand Pain: Often Caused by Overuse, a Therapist's Top 6 Exercises for Relief Rheumatoid Arthritis Relief: This Ancient Therapy's Benefits for Pain and Swelling Raynaud’s phenomenon (also known as Raynaud’s disease or syndrome) is characterized by abnormal vasoconstriction of the small blood vessels of the fingers and toes. It most often affects the fingers and, in rare cases, the ears and nose. Primary: This is the most common form and isn’t a result of another medical condition. When mild, many people don’t seek treatment. Secondary: This is associated with another health condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, scleroderma, or Sjogren’s syndrome. Medications can also play a role. Certain blood pressure, migraine, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medications can exacerbate Raynaud’s syndrome. Smoking is also a risk factor because it narrows the blood vessels. Although exposure to cold temperatures remains the most common cause of flare-ups, repetitive actions or vibrations (such as using jackhammers, typing, or playing the piano) can also trigger bouts of Raynaud’s. Bouts of Raynaud’s syndrome are generally temporary, but some people can have episodes frequent enough or long enough to develop skin ulcers and even gangrene in affected areas.

        "content": "M y life has been ruled by epilepsy since I was a teenager. At 14, I suddenly started experiencing severe seizures as a result of a stroke I’d suffered at birth. At some points, I’d have up to 20 a week – many so violent that I’d break my own nose by punching myself in the face. I rely heavily on the support of my family – I’m now 24, but I’ve never been able to move out from our home in Warwickshire, or stay overnight without them, as there’s always a risk that I might suffer a dangerous seizure without warning. In October 2021, when I was 21, we were on holiday in Cornwall, enjoying walks and steaming-hot pasties. I remember browsing in a jewellery shop in St Ives and buying a painting, but then my mind goes blank. I woke up in a hospital bed 10 days later, bones broken and unable to communicate. My family spent months helping me piece together what had happened. After walking around St Ives, we’d gone on a short hike along the cliffs from Land’s End. At one point, the coastal path narrows and is only about three metres from the rugged cliff edge. My dad saw me suddenly drop off the side of the cliff. I’d had an epileptic fit and fell 40ft, my body ricocheting off the rocks below. My mum saw me from above, lying in a pool of water, a deep shade of crimson lapping around my ears. I had suffered a cardiac arrest, lost three litres of blood and technically died for several minutes Mum somehow managed to climb down the cliff face and found me breathing, though she says my skull had caved in. With the help of a passerby and two paramedics, I was hoisted on to a higher rock to stop me being swept away by the rising tide. After a couple of hours, we were lifted away in a helicopter, and I woke up days later in Treliske hospital in Truro. I had suffered a cardiac arrest, lost three litres of blood and technically died for several minutes. A senior nurse told my family they wouldn’t be able to save me. I still have to stop myself dwelling on that in order to focus on the future. As well as a fractured skull, I had three spinal injuries, both my lungs had collapsed and my pelvis was in multiple pieces. I had a degloving injury on my bottom, where my tissues were ripped from the underlying muscle, which eventually led to me developing sepsis. The only reason I’ve been able to walk again is because my feet were partially protected by my Doc Martens – an orthopaedic doctor told me my left heel had turned to dust. My boots are completely battered, but I’ll keep them for ever. My memories of the first few weeks are hazy: a speech therapist feeding me trifle to see if I could swallow; my sister, Beth, sitting at the side of my bed drinking a smoothie; the searing pain in my head and back. Due to the trauma to my brain, over the 10 months I was in hospital, I would regularly forget why I was there. I’m used to having blanks in my memory because of my epilepsy, but it’s still upsetting when I can’t remember. My mum made a photo diary, but it felt like I was looking at pictures of someone else. This summer I went to visit the team that saved me, but I had no memory of them. I felt awkward in a way, but it was important for me to thank them. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Most people thought I’d have to rely on a wheelchair after my accident, but, although moving is painful, I can walk quite well now. And my memory is better than expected – I managed to watch Pulp Fiction and understand the plot, which was a huge milestone. It’s about celebrating the small victories. In a surreal twist, although my body was badly damaged by the accident, my epilepsy has started to get better. Doctors think the cardiac arrest starved my brain of oxygen long enough to “dampen” the parts causing epilepsy – but not long enough to cause major brain damage – and I’m now only having five or six seizures a month. Before, my epilepsy was so bad that I didn’t really have any quality of life. The day I almost died has turned out to be the day I got my life back, and I’m determined to keep living it.

        "description": "Erin Finley, an award-winning artist in Canada, is the creator of Memory Drawing, a program that helps older adults tap into their memories and express them in vibrant color.",
        "content": "close Video Fox News Flash top headlines for December 14 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. For many aging seniors , memories are precious and fleeting. Now, one Canadian artist is helping some of them capture their favorite scenes in lasting works of art. Erin Finley is an award-winning artist who teaches at OCAD University in Canada. She's the creator of Memory Drawing, a program that helps older adults tap into their memories and express them in vibrant color. Each month, Finley visits a large long-term care facility in Toronto, where she guides residents through the process of creating unique pieces through drawing, coloring and painting. PICKLEBALL HELPS BOOST SENIORS’ MENTAL HEALTH, OFFERING 'ADAPTABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY,' SURVEY FINDS The residents range from intrepid, seasoned artists to beginners who are a bit nervous at first, Finley told Fox News Digital in a video interview. Regardless of their skill level, there's a lot to gain from the sessions, she said. Finley is pictured with one of the artists she works with at the long-term care center. Each week, she visits a long-term care facility in Toronto, where she guides residents through the process of creating their own unique pieces. (Erin Finley) \"I love that they all bring their own life experiences and their own bodies of work that they develop through memory drawing activities,\" she said. Finley first got the idea for Memory Drawing during the COVID-19 pandemic , when she saw \"heartbreaking images\" of people in long-term care facilities who couldn't be with their loved ones. MOST SENIORS IN AMERICA CAN’T AFFORD NURSING HOMES OR ASSISTED LIVING, STUDY FINDS \"I thought, 'What can I do? I'm not in health care , but I want to do something,'\" she said. The artist started contacting local facilities pitching her idea — and the program was born. ‘Self-guided and eager’ For each session, Finley brings some prompts for those who need a little more direction — but she pointed out that some of the seniors are \"very self-guided and eager to tap into their own imaginations.\" Seasonal elements are a popular prompt. In the fall, for example, Finley encourages the seniors to think about the crinkly sound of leaves, the changing colors and the trees moving in the wind. In spring, they might create art based on their favorite flowers. One of the artists at the senior center shows off her artwork at left. At right, Finley is pictured in her art studio. (Erin Finley) As they draw and paint, the group talks about the memories that inspired their work, which often involve favorite people, places and things, Finley said. Sometimes an artist brings a photo of a beloved person or object to recreate. One of the artists is a Corvette enthusiast, for example — so he creates art inspired by the memories of cars he drove and loved as a young man. CAN YOU REDUCE ALZHEIMER’S RISK BY SEEING A HEALTH COACH? COGNITIVE STUDY SUGGESTS IT’S POSSIBLE For residents with cognitive decline , Finley said the art sessions can help spark and sharpen memories, particularly when the seniors focus on texture or touch. For one of the artists, Finley usually starts the drawing and lets him finish. \"I love that they all bring their own life experiences and their own bodies of work that they develop through memory drawing activities,\" Finley said. She's shown here working with a group of artists. (Erin Finley) \"I'll draw half of a maple leaf and he draws the other half,\" she said. \"It adds an interactive component.\" Overall, she said she tries to \"be nimble\" and \"give the residents what they need and what brings them joy.\" ‘So inspired’ Finley said she is constantly inspired by the creativity the seniors exhibit. \"One of the artists takes watercolor paint, which is a dry medium, adds water to it and paints with his thumb,\" she said. \"The end result looks like a beautiful oil painting .\" \"It's uplifting for me. It makes me feel like I'm making a difference and helping in some regard.\" \"The ingenuity is just mind-boggling, and I'm so inspired by it every time I visit.\" As each piece is completed, Finley presents it to the group and celebrates the accomplishment. \"I might lift up the work and say, ‘This is what Lester has done today.’ And then we have a kind of cool gallery moment and we celebrate.\" SENIORS WITH DEMENTIA ARE TREATED TO 'BABY SHOWER' WITH DOLLS TO HELP RELIEVE STRESS: 'SENSE OF PURPOSE' One of the residents is deaf, Finley said, and so the individual communicates only through drawing. \"She'll pass me an image and I'll pass one back — it's beautiful.\" The finished pieces are sometimes displayed in the nursing home or given to loved ones . \"Sometimes they are kind of understood to be legacy pieces, so when a family member passes on, they become the prized belongings of the adult children and the remaining family,\" Finley told Fox News Digital. Finley is shown in her art studio displaying one of her creations. An award-winning artist, she teaches at OCAD University in Canada. (Erin Finley) \"This can be a difficult time for some of the adult children of the seniors I work with, but I get to go in and help them access these memories and create something wonderful for them to enjoy.\" Beyond helping the seniors tap into their own memories, Finley said she herself has also benefited. \"It's uplifting for me,\" she said. \"It makes me feel like I'm making a difference and helping in some regard.\" \"Engaging in artistic activities stimulates certain areas of the brain, helping to keep the mind sharp and active.\" There is also a community-building aspect to the Memory Drawing project, Finley noted, as it brings people out of their isolated spaces and into a collaborative, creative environment for the 90-minute sessions. \"The residents are socializing with each other more than they might have before,\" she said. \"While enacting a painting, we have conversations that are outside the realm of their regular daily routines.\" next Image 1 of 3 An artist at the long-term care facility is pictured with his artwork.

(Erin Finley) Looking ahead, Finley hopes to expand her program to include more nursing homes. \"Maybe the next phase will be enlisting specific artists to be instructors and hold art encounters,\" she said. Benefits of art for seniors Dr. John Whyte, a practicing physician in Washington, D.C. , and chief medical officer of WebMD, shared with Fox News Digital some of the mind-boosting benefits of art for older adults. \"Engaging in artistic activities stimulates certain areas of the brain, helping to keep the mind sharp and active,\" he said. \"This mental stimulation may delay the onset of cognitive decline associated with aging .\" In terms of cognitive health, a doctor noted that artistic activities stimulate neuroplasticity, which is the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections. (Erin Finley) Creating art can also improve seniors’ motor skills, he noted. \"Artistic activities require fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination, which can maintain or improve these abilities in seniors,\" said Whyte. \"Those skills are important for the activities of daily living.\" Art also encourages emotional expression, he noted, which is especially beneficial for seniors who may face social isolation or emotional challenges. 10 TIPS TO LIVE TO BE 100: ‘FAR MORE THAN WISHFUL THINKING,' SAY LONGEVITY EXPERTS \"The act of creating art can be therapeutic and meditative , reducing stress and promoting a sense of calm and relaxation,\" Whyte said. In terms of cognitive health, the doctor noted that artistic activities stimulate neuroplasticity, which is the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections. \"Art projects require attention to detail and concentration.\" Creating art can also trigger memories and stimulate storytelling, he said, \"aiding in the recall of past events and strengthening memory pathways.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER The activity also builds the ability to focus, Whyte said. \"Art projects require attention to detail and concentration, which can enhance these cognitive abilities in seniors.\" Finley is pictured in her art studio. \"The ingenuity is just mind-boggling, and I'm so inspired by it every time I visit,\" she said of her Memory Drawing project.

        "description": "Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), chair of the Senate Finance Committee, vowed to meet monthly with Social Security officials until the problems surrounding overpayment demands are fixed.",
        "content": "The Senate Finance Committee is ramping up oversight of Social Security’s overpayment problem and plans to meet with the agency every month “ .” This story is part of the “Overpayment Outrage” series on TV stations. It can be Do you have an experience with Social Security overpayments you’d like to share? to contact our reporting team. Social Security has been overpaying billions of dollars to people, many on disability — then demanding the money back, even if the government made mistakes, an investigation by KFF Health News and Cox Media Group revealed. The reporting has triggered harsh criticism in Congress and led to an investigation by the agency. The Social Security Administration assured lawmakers in the past that it had been addressed, but “what you all found in your reporting is that the problem hadn’t been fixed,” Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said in an interview. Wyden was referring to by KFF Health News and Cox Media Group television stations reporting how the agency has been issuing billions of dollars in overpayments — benefits it claims people never should have received — and then, sometimes years later, the money back. “Millions of these individuals are walking an economic tightrope, balancing their food bill against the fuel bill, the fuel bill against the rent bill,” Wyden said. “And they have one of these overpayments and it just hits them like a wrecking ball.” Meanwhile, congressional legislation that would raise asset limits for millions of Social Security recipients for the first time in decades has been gaining support. The amounts the agency alleges people owe the government often total tens of thousands of dollars. The recipients include many of the nation’s most vulnerable — people who are disabled and have minimal savings and incomes. Often the overpayments result from errors or lapses on the part of the Social Security Administration. The agency has been sending overpayment notices to a year, according to a government document KFF Health News and CMG obtained through a request under the Freedom of Information Act. The notices typically ask recipients to repay the government within 30 days. They also explain how to appeal or request that the government waive the debt. The Finance Committee oversees Social Security. Wyden spoke with KFF Health News and CMG on Dec. 12 in his first interview with the news organizations since they began reporting on Social Security overpayments and clawbacks months ago. He was elaborating on a statement the committee posted last week. “As the point person for getting this fixed, I’m committing to getting this turned around,” Wyden said. “Your reporting has just been invaluable in terms of kind of opening up a lot of visibility and awareness to something that needs to be fixed.” Wyden is co-sponsor of a Senate bill that would address one of the root causes of overpayments. (WSB-TV, Atlanta) In the Supplemental Security Income program, which provides monthly checks to people who have little or no income or assets and are over 65 or disabled, asset limits for beneficiaries haven’t been adjusted since the 1980s. Those limits stand at $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples. The bill, spearheaded by Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.), to $10,000 and $20,000, respectively, and adjust them for inflation in the future. The bill has seven other , including recent additions Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), chair of the Appropriations Committee. Chief executives of several major Wall Street firms, including Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, expressed support for the bill at a recent hearing, . At a September news conference on Capitol Hill, a representative of JPMorgan Chase, which also backs the proposal, said the asset limits often prevent employees from participating in a 401(k) retirement plan to which the firm makes matching contributions. A in the House of Representatives has 10 lawmakers behind it. “With growing bipartisan support in Congress and among the business and faith communities, we have a good chance to finally get this done,” Brown said in a statement for this article. Subscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing. Legislation to raise the asset limits could be included in a government funding bill early next year, Brown spokesperson Kevin Donohoe said. Wyden said he hopes the legislation becomes a campaign issue in the election year and that candidates are asked whether they support it. The monthly meetings with the Social Security Administration will begin when a new commissioner is in place, Wyden said. President Joe Biden’s nominee to head the agency, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley (D), cleared the Finance Committee and is awaiting a confirmation vote by the full Senate. In a recent hearing, O’Malley said accounts of people facing clawbacks were “heartbreaking” and promised to make the issue a priority. Wyden said he expects the oversight meetings will include the top Republican on the Finance Committee, Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho. A spokesperson for Crapo, Mandi Critchfield, said he “is committed to addressing the overpayments issue, and looks forward to working with Senator Wyden to conduct proper oversight.” One of the goals for those meetings, Wyden said, is to find out whether the agency can do more about overpayments using the legal powers it already has, including the authority to waive debts. Wyden said he has discussed Social Security overpayments and clawbacks with officials at the White House. In the interview, Wyden also addressed a recent report by KFF Health News and CMG that, according to the results of a public records request, the SSA has been sending overpayment notices to over a than the agency’s acting commissioner, Kilolo Kijakazi, . “When you have Social Security officials not telling the truth — and that’s how I would characterize that report on the number of people for whom there was actually a problem — it really damages this incredibly important program’s credibility,” Wyden said. The news organizations obtained a copy of a piece of paper from which Kijakazi read aloud some numbers but not others at the October hearing. SSA spokesperson Nicole Tiggemann said last week the agency could not confirm the accuracy of the counts — those Kijakazi presented at the hearing and those she left out. Meanwhile, senior Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee issued a statement this week on overpayments and clawbacks. “Recent news reports have highlighted that the harm and unfairness Social Security beneficiaries experience after unknowingly being overpaid is more widespread than previously thought,” Reps. John B. Larson of Connecticut and Danny K. Davis of Illinois said. Larson is the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security, and Davis is the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Work and Welfare. “The need for action is clear,” they said. “There must be a fundamental overhaul of Social Security’s overpayment process – one that puts seniors and Americans with severe disabilities first.” While the government is at fault for some overpayments, others result from beneficiaries failing to comply with requirements, intentionally or otherwise. That can include failing to keep the SSA updated about items such as earnings, assets, and in-kind support — for example, whether family members are giving the beneficiary food or a place to stay. Systemic problems also contribute. The SSA has relied on manual systems, and those are subject to human error. Rules are complex and difficult for SSA staff and beneficiaries alike to follow. People who receive yet try to work can easily run afoul of restrictions not only on how much they are allowed to save but also on how much they are allowed to earn. For individuals who aren’t blind, the is $1,470. The SSA relies heavily on beneficiaries to report changes in income, assets, and the like. For instance, the agency has been slow to implement systems that would automatically tap payroll data from outside sources. Beneficiaries and advocates for Social Security recipients say the agency frequently loses information they submit. Getting through to humans at the agency can be extremely difficult, they say. Wait times are long, and calls get dropped. O’Malley, the nominee for commissioner, recently told the Senate Finance Committee that the agency has a “ .” “The current wait times, backlogs, and delays are simply unacceptable,” O’Malley wrote. The agency has cited staffing and funding. In the 2023 fiscal year, “we began to rebuild our workforce after ending FY 2022 with the lowest staffing level in 25 years,” the acting commissioner said in an October statement to a congressional subcommittee. The agency closed field offices during the pandemic. That made it more difficult for beneficiaries to communicate with the SSA, and it caused problems to pile up. The agency checks benefits retrospectively, which , researchers at the Urban Institute have said. Regardless of who was originally at fault, by the time the SSA issues an overpayment notice, years can pass and the alleged overpayment total can balloon. Under federal law, the agency must try to recover overpaid amounts, Kijakazi said in her October statement, and there is no statute of limitations. To collect debts, the SSA can reach back decades and across generations.",

        "content": "MADERA, Calif. (KFSN) -- Every Wednesday morning, Jill Campbell scrubs in for her shift at Valley Children's Hospital in Madera. Even after teaching for 40 years, Campbell still wanted retirement to include kids. Campbell is one of about 50 volunteer cuddlers at Valley Children's. It's a position she takes seriously. \"I just love being with the babies,\" she said. \"I love knowing that I can hold the babies when their parents can't be here - and not every family can be here all the time, so that's where I come in. I get to love their babies while they're not here.\" Cuddlers hold, rock and soothe the hospital's tiniest, most critical patients. \"These babies are babies who are usually about three pounds or more,\" says Stacie Venkatesan with Valley Children's. \"We also have a large population of very big babies who have surgical needs, and they often are with us a long time recuperating from their surgeries.\" Campbell will walk the halls of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, listening for a baby who needs some extra care. Cuddlers are trained by neonatal nurses on how to properly hold the infants. Campbell says she can't imagine a better way to spend her day than loving on a precious little boy or girl. \"It is something that gives me purpose,\" she said. Whether it's five minutes or maybe two hours, volunteers' comforting cuddles do serve a purpose. Not only does it allow nurses to provide care to other babies, cuddlers help them develop into healthy babies. \"Their sight and their hearing are all part of being held and being interacted with in a positive way,\" Venkatesan said. Since cuddlers are dealing with some of the most medically-fragile patients, Valley Children's is selective about who can become one. Candidates are promoted from the Patient Pal volunteer group, and there's usually a waitlist to become a cuddler. Campbell ends each shift knowing she made a difference in the lives of the littlest patients - leaving her more fulfilled every day. \"I think everybody should do it,\" she said.

According to a media statement, the programme is now allowing the conduct of telemedicine services at night and on holidays. Patients who have had face-to-face treatment within the past six months from a clinic can now also access telemedicine. About 100 islands and remote areas where health services remain inaccessible have also been designated as \"medically vulnerable areas\" where telemedicine can also be provided. Moreover, the programme prohibits downloading original prescriptions through a telemedicine application to prevent falsification. Recently, it was brought to the ministry's attention that some providers had prescribed commonly abused medications, violating the telemedicine rule. Synapxe integrates Lunit AI CXR into 2 SingHealth hospitals Singapore General Hospital and Changi General Hospital, both under SingHealth, have recently adopted the AI-based chest X-ray solution from Lunit. Synapxe, Singapore's national health tech agency, has integrated the Lunit INSIGHT CXR into the clinical radiology workflow of the two hospitals through the AimSG, the national AI platform for medical imaging. The integration was initiated through Lunit's partnership with NTT DATA Singapore, which is also part of the AimSG project. It is expected that Lunit's AI will help enhance the hospitals' ability to interpret and diagnose chest diseases.

        "description": "Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy has presented a budget plan that proposes paying residents a $3,400 oil-wealth dividend next year and using savings to cover a $990 million deficit.",
        "content": "close Video Alaska man finds himself on the same path as a large moose in Anchorage A cautious observer captures the moment he encountered a large moose walking through a neighborhood near Anchorage, AK. Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy revealed a budget plan proposing a $3,400 oil-wealth dividend for residents next year. The budget does not include an increase in the per-student K-12 school funding formula, but Dunleavy, a former educator, anticipates education discussions during the upcoming legislative session. Other items in the budget plan include funding for staff to address a food stamp benefits backlog. Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy unveiled a budget plan Thursday that would pay residents an oil-wealth dividend of about $3,400 next year using a formula that lawmakers have all but abandoned and use savings to plug an estimated $990 million deficit. The proposal does not include an increase in the per-student K-12 school funding formula, though Dunleavy, a former educator, said he expected education to be at the fore of discussions when lawmakers convene for their new legislative session next month. He said he wanted lawmakers to consider his proposal from last session that would provide bonuses to teachers as a way to help recruit and retain them. Dunleavy blasted the federal government and groups that have challenged oil, mining and other development projects in Alaska , saying it has left the state with choices such as having to make budget cuts, tax residents and businesses, or reduce the size of the yearly dividend. Alaska has no state sales tax or personal income tax, and for years, without resolution, lawmakers have talked about the need for a fiscal plan that moves away from the boom-bust cycles of budgeting tied to the state's reliance on a volatile commodity: Oil. ALASKA LAWMAKERS PASS SPENDING PACKAGE, ENDING SPECIAL SESSION IN ONE DAY Central to a fiscal plan is how much the yearly dividend should be. For years, until 2015, the dividend was paid according to a formula that many lawmakers have since come to view as unsustainable and unaffordable. In 2016, amid deficits, then-Gov. Bill Walker vetoed about half the amount available for dividends, and the state Supreme Court later decided the dividend program must compete for annual funding like any other state program. Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy speaks to reporters during a news conference at which he unveiled his budget proposals for the coming year on Dec. 14, 2023, in Juneau, Alaska. Dunleavy said the spending proposal includes a deficit of nearly $1 billion that he proposes using savings to cover. (AP Photo/Becky Bohrer) The amount has since been set by what can get enough votes to get a budget passed, with debate over the size of the check often overshadowing other issues. This year's dividend was $1,312 and cost about $880 million, with a potential for a bonus check of up to $500 next year if oil prices exceed forecasts. Dunleavy on Thursday proposed a dividend for next year in line with the formula last used in 2015, at a cost of about $2.3 billion for checks to residents of about $3,400 each, his budget office estimated. The toll of inflation is \"taking a bite out of everybody’s pocketbook. So we’re hoping that we can keep the PFD as high as possible to help Alaskans afford groceries, afford fuel, etc.,\" Dunleavy said at a news conference, referring to the Permanent Fund Dividend. AK GOV. MIKE DUNLEAVY PROPOSES $8.3M FUNDING BOOST TO ADDRESS CASELOAD, STAFFING ISSUES FOR PUBLIC DEFENDER The budget proposal is a starting point. The House and Senate will each have a chance to craft their own versions of the budget, which typically get reconciled through negotiations near the end of a legislative session. The 40-member House has a Republican-led majority. The 20-member Senate is controlled by a bipartisan majority. Senate Finance Committee Co-chair Bert Stedman, a Sitka Republican, in a statement said a focus \"will continue to be a balanced budget without having to dip into our significantly low reserves. It’s our job to allocate resources wisely while addressing the needs of our communities.\" Administration officials on Thursday outlined other items in the budget plan for the fiscal year starting July 1 and as supplemental items for the current year, including funding for additional staff to process a backlog in food stamp benefits. As part of the budget for the current year, the Legislature approved a one-time, $175 million funding boost for schools in response to pleas from local officials seeking a more permanent funding increase. School officials have said that inflation and fixed costs like heating were taking a toll on their budgets and in some cases forcing program cuts or requiring increased class sizes. But Dunleavy vetoed half that extra funding. GOV. DUNLEAVY WANTS TO MAKE AK THE ‘MOST PRO-LIFE STATE’ IN THE US On Thursday, some education leaders said they were disappointed Dunleavy didn't include in his proposal an increase in the school funding formula. Jharrett Bryantt, superintendent of the Anchorage School District, said Alaska districts \"are struggling to attract and retain teachers and classroom support positions due to wages and benefits that cannot compete with those offered in the Lower 48. This directly results in lower student outcomes and larger class sizes.\" He said his district has \"hundreds of open positions that it struggles to fill because of how prospective educators view current conditions of the profession in Alaska.\"",

After countries agreed this week at UN climate talks on a \"transitioning away from fossil fuels\", governments are likely to come under heightened pressure to boost regulation and reject further expansion of oil, gas and coal projects. But that could leave them open to litigation under a secretive arbitration process called investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS), according to UN rights expert David Boyd, who has called it a \"major obstacle\" to environmental action. \"When governments bring in these stronger laws and policies, they're ending up paying millions -- and sometimes billions -- of dollars in compensation,\" Boyd told AFP. Denmark, France and New Zealand have all backed off from stronger regulation on fossil fuel exploration because of ISDS fears, he said. In a report called \"Paying Polluters\", presented to the UN General Assembly earlier this year, Boyd warned that the number of claims -- and the size of the payouts -- were soaring. \"The explosion of ISDS claims in recent years, and the threat of such claims, is led by fossil fuel, mining and other extractive industry corporations,\" Boyd said in his report. ISDS cases targeting actions to protect the environment rose from 12 initiated before 2000, to 37 from 2000 to 2010, and 126 between 2011 and 2021, it said, adding fossil fuel and mining industries have won over $100 billion in awards. That could rise substantially, as \"sunset clauses\" mean even if a state pulls out of a treaty it could still face litigation for some two decades. ISDS mechanisms built into thousands of international treaties have roots in the global reconfiguration after World War Two, as investors based often in former colonial powers sought to protect assets in newly-independent countries. Lukas Schaugg, an international law analyst with the International Institute for Sustainable Development, said the tribunals had historically operated with a \"lack of public scrutiny\". \"People are increasingly talking about the duty of states to regulate with regard to climate,\" said Schaugg, who used to work at the International Chamber of Commerce's arbitration court. Now, \"the clash with the investment treaty regime is increasingly visible\", he said. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development says ISDS poses a particular challenge for the energy transition. In an August report, UNCTAD said of 1,257 publicly-known ISDS claims made by early 2023, 15 percent were initiated by fossil fuel investors. Even renewable companies have filed substantial claims, as countries change investment incentives. The Energy Charter Treaty is the most frequently-invoked international investment agreement in these claims. It \"can amplify existing burdens on countries that are trying to shift from traditional fossil fuel projects to renewable energies\", UNCTAD said. Several wealthy nations have moved to pull out of the ECT, including Germany, France and the Netherlands, while the European Parliament has called for withdrawal of the entire EU. Boyd said even as richer nations reduce their exposure, investors continue to use their territory to target poorer nations. \"It's absolutely gross hypocrisy, it's unjust and it's definitely unequal,\" he said, adding that \"jurisdiction shopping\" also allows foreign companies to open offices in treaty countries to launch claims. According to UNCTAD, 65 percent of cases in 2022 were brought by investors in richer nations -- and 65 percent of cases were against developing countries. Examples of claims include two Australian mining corporations seeking nearly $37 billion from the Republic of Congo -- more than twice its 2022 gross domestic product. \"It's obvious that there's no way on earth the Republic of Congo could pay that kind of compensation, if they were unsuccessful in these claims,\" Boyd told AFP. Often, he said, \"governments just capitulate\". Last year, Pakistan agreed an out-of-court settlement with a foreign firm, which waived penalties that had ballooned to $11 billion in exchange for the reopening of an open-pit copper mine. It was seen as the only solution for the debt-stricken country after a World Bank arbitration tribunal imposed a $5.8 billion penalty in 2019. The Tethyan Copper company told the tribunal it had spent over $240 million on the mine. Boyd said the case illustrates inconsistencies in tribunal awards. Payouts are sometimes based on investors' actual spending on a project, but at other times use a method estimating future earnings. Boyd called for the investment treaty system to be reimagined to align with rights and environmental priorities -- and for ISDS to be \"relegated to the dustbin of history\". \"We've known there's been a climate crisis for 30 years (but) we have companies operating coal fired power plants, saying: 'We had a legitimate expectation we'd be able to continue burning coal forever',\" he said. \"Those arguments are being accepted by these arbitration tribunals.\" © Copyright AFP 2023.

        "description": "The passage comes after Sen. Tommy Tuberville dropped his blockade of military promotions on Dec. 5.",
        "content": "The U.S. Senate passed a bill on Thursday that would grant pay back to military officers whose promotions had been delayed for months due to Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s (R-Ala.) unprecedented legislative blockade. The bill, proposed by Sens. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), was unanimously passed on Dec. 14. This passage came after Mr. Tuberville dropped his blockade of military promotions on Dec. 5. Speaking on the Senate floor on Dec. 14, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the bill’s passage signifies the stance that military service members “don’t deserve to be penalized in any way at all.” “Finally, we are able to right the wrong of Senator Tuberville’s illogical, hurtful, and dangerous holds and the massive impacts the holds had on military families,” Mr. Schumer remarked. “These men and women have worked so hard for our country for so long. [And] because of Senator Tuberville, in a really nasty and whimsical holding back of their promotions, they weren’t getting paid. \"Tonight at long last we are giving these military families, families that have already sacrificed so much, the justice they deserve: their back pay,\" he added. House Passes Massive Defense Bill Despite FISA Objections Senate Passes $886 Billion Defense Policy Bill Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) welcomed the Senate approval and said that military officers \"do not serve any particular political party,\" but rather the nation as a whole. The senator and other conservatives argued that the new policy violates a federal law that bars the use of federal tax dollars to pay for abortions, though the Department of Health and Human Services does so indirectly with substantial funding of the procedure to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. The Senate approved 425 promotions shortly after Mr. Tuberville announced the withdrawal of his blockade. President Joe Biden said the Republican’s hold of military nominations was \"politically motivated.\" “These confirmations are long overdue, and should never have been held up in the first place. Our service members are the backbone of our country and deserve to receive the pay and promotions they have earned,” President Biden said on Dec. 5. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes funding for the multiyear procurement of 10 Virginia class submarines and the development of nuclear-armed cruise missile. It also includes a trilateral nuclear-powered submarine pact with Britain and Australia (AUKUS), initiatives to counter Russia in Europe, foil China in the Pacific, and aid Israel in the Middle East, and investments in Space Force and technologies including artificial intelligence and hypersonics. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed (D-R.I.) said the NDAA will strengthen the U.S. military posture in the Indo-Pacific and secure the nation's interests \"against China’s expanding ambitions.\" \"The bill will reinvigorate our industrial base and provide our military services with the cutting-edge platforms and technologies they need to keep Americans safe,\" Mr. Reed said in a statement.",

Russia has a decades-old tradition of legal abortions, with the issue less divisive as in many more religious Western countries. But over the last few months a flurry of regions have rushed to restrict abortions in private clinics, yielding to demands from the Russian Orthodox church. And health officials have doubled down on policies at state clinics to try to discourage women from terminating. Authorities say they aim to improve Russia's dire demographics, despite evidence that restricting abortion does not increase birth rates and puts women at risk. Activists see it as part of a wider crackdown. \"When a country is at war, it is usually accompanied by this kind of legislation,\" Leda Garina, a Russian feminist activist exiled in Georgia, told AFP. The measures, she said, sent a clear message to Russian women: \"Sit at home and give birth to more soldiers.\" The timing has raised eyebrows -- Russia's abortion rate has already fallen \"almost tenfold\" since the 1990s, according to Russian demographer Viktoria Sakevich. Russian President Vladimir Putin said this week that he was against banning abortion, but that terminations were against state interests. The 71-year-old said he wanted women to \"safeguard the life of the child\" in order to \"resolve the demographic problem\". Russia's abortion debate comes as Putin seeks re-election in March and as he projects an ever more conservative vision of what a Russian family should look like. For years the president has offered financial incentives for Russians to have more children, with the population shrinking fast since the 1990s. But since the Ukraine war, this has acquired new meaning. \"They see this as a question of national survival,\" said political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya. And Putin sees any resistance to social positions adopted by the Kremlin as a Western ploy, she added. \"Abortions are now part of it. They think that convincing a woman to have an abortion is way of worsening Russia's demographic problem -- that it is the West's plan,\" Stanovaya said. Last month, Orthodox church leader Patriarch Kirill urged authorities to curb abortions, claiming the population could be increased with \"the wave of a magic wand\". Since then more than a dozen regions moved to stop or limit abortions in private clinics. Non-state clinics perform mostly pill-based procedures and ask fewer question, according to Sakevich, making them popular for urban women. Government clinics for years have held \"consultations\" seeking to dissuade women from the procedure. But new health ministry recommendations for doctors encourage a more heavy-handed strategy. \"There is a position of trying to stop them, putting pressure on them, scaring them,\" Sakevich said. Some regions, she said, even offer bonuses to doctors if they deter women. If private clinics were banned from performing abortions, Sakevich predicted there could be a \"grey zone\" of clinics taking on paid abortions, hitting poor women the hardest. Sakevich feared it could lead to a black market of abortion pills and even backstreet abortions. Russia's pro-life movement was once marginal but the war has created a \"political environment\" to press more radical initiatives, Stanovaya said. It has also divided the Putin camp. Some male politicians rushed to back restrictions, while Valentina Matvienko -- Russia's highest ranking woman politician -- warned a ban could have \"tragic consequences\". Political analyst Ekaterina Schulmann said the debate is intended to give Russians something to talk about in a pre-election period where \"you can't talk about the war or the state of the economy.\" She said authorities were tackling the demographic problem from the wrong angle. \"They should be fighting early male deaths -- the main cause of a shrinking population -- instead of trying to get women to have more children,\" she said. But talking about men living longer is taboo at a time when Moscow has sent hundreds of thousands of young and middle-aged men to the battlefields in Ukraine. Observers fear the latest restrictions could just be the beginning. \"We can expect more bans, more restrictions,\" said Sergei Zakharov, a senior Russian demographer at the University of Strasbourg in France. Abortions could be removed from the state insurance system, as the church wants, he warned. Zakharov said trying to increase birth rates \"by all means, including restricting abortions, is something Franco's Spain or Mussolini's Italy\" did, adding: \"This has never worked anywhere.\" Experts say male mortality is the elephant in the room with Russia's dire demographics AFP Russian Patriotic Youth movement cadets visit Red Square in Moscow.

The high court judge ruled in favour of the Duke of Sussex in 15 of the 33 sample articles that he submitted as evidence in his lawsuit against MGN, which publishes The Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People. Justice Timothy Fancourt said he had concluded that the newspapers carried out \"extensive\" phone hacking of celebrities between 2006 and 2011, even when a public inquiry into the conduct of the British press was ongoing. \"I consider that his phone was only hacked to a modest extent, and that this was probably carefully controlled by certain people at each newspaper,\" Fancourt said. Prince Harry said in a statement read outside court by his lawyer that the ruling was \"vindicating and affirming\". In a statement a spokesperson for MGN said: \"Where historical wrongdoing took place, we apologise unreservedly, have taken full responsibility and paid appropriate compensation.\" Harry, the younger son of King Charles III, became the first British royal in over a century to take to the witness stand when he gave evidence in the trial. The last time a royal had given evidence in court was in the 1890s, when the future king Edward VII took the stand in a slander trial. Harry, 39, accused the publisher of \"industrial scale\" phone hacking during emotional testimony in which he relived upsetting episodes of his life. He argued he had been the victim of relentless and distressing media intrusion virtually his entire life. The prince and several other claimants alleged the titles engaged in \"illegal information gathering\", including intercepting phone voice mails, to write dozens of stories about him. The Duke of Sussex, as he is also known, has launched legal action against several tabloid media groups, alongside barrages of attacks aimed at his family and the monarchy. \"I've been told that slaying dragons will get you burned,\" he said in his statement. \"But in light of today's victory and the importance of doing what is needed for a free and honest press it's a worthwhile price to pay. The mission continues.\" MGN had admitted to \"some evidence\" of unlawful information gathering, including for a story about Harry. But it had denied voicemail interception and also argued that some claims were brought too late by Harry and the other claimants. Harry has long had a turbulent relationship with the press and holds the media responsible for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, in a 1997 Paris car crash while being pursued by paparazzi. Allegations that tabloid journalists hacked into celebrities' phones first emerged two decades ago and prompted the Leveson inquiry into press conduct. It found that British newspapers had \"wreaked havoc with the lives of innocent people\" and led to the closure of Britain's top-selling newspaper, the Rupert Murdoch-owned News of the World, in 2011. Harry quit the royal family for a life in California with his American wife Meghan and now has a difficult relationship with his father and his brother, Prince William. © Copyright AFP 2023.

        "content": "Senate Republicans in Alabama introduced new legislation on Dec. 12 aimed at promoting election security by ensuring non-American citizens are not able to vote in federal elections. Under the measure, states would be given the power to ensure that individuals provide proof of American citizenship when registering to vote via mail-in application. Specifically, the bill would amend the National Voting Rights Act (NVRA) to put in place proof of citizenship requirement for both the federal mail voter registration form and any state mail voter registration forms. The bill relates to Section 6 of the NVRA, which requires that each state accept and use the federal mail voter registration application forms developed by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission but allows states to develop their own voter registration forms provided they meet all of the same criteria the NVRA requires for the federal mail voter registration form. However, the Republican lawmakers said the Election Assistance Commission and the courts have begun interpreting the prohibition on \"any requirement for notarization or other formal authentication\" as \"precluding efforts by some States to include a requirement of documentary proof of American citizenship with the federal form.\" US Supreme Court Won't Intervene in Key Voting Rights Act Challenge Judge Nullifies Election Over Illegal Votes The co-sponsors of the legislation include all Republican members of the Senate Rules Committee, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Rules Committee Ranking Member Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), and Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) In a statement announcing the newly introduced legislation, Ms. Britt, a member of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, said voting in U.S. elections is a \"sacred right that must solely be limited to American citizens,\" and called her measure \"commonsense.\" \"To allow States to uphold this principle should be simple commonsense, \" she said. \"We are seeing certain cities across our nation begin to openly allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. This effectively disenfranchises hardworking American citizens, insults those American citizens who came to our country legally and took the time and effort to go through the citizenship process, and undermines faith in our entire electoral system – which is a cornerstone of our nation that we cannot allow to crumble.\" \"States have the legal right to prevent noncitizens – including illegal migrants and official representatives of foreign adversaries – from voting in State and Federal elections,\" she concluded. Meanwhile, Mr. Palmer said the American people \"deserve an election system with impeccable integrity\" and that both he and Ms. Britt's legislation will provide a solution to protect the vote of American citizens. \"Her companion legislation will help stop the steady march toward allowing noncitizens to vote in elections around the country. Allowing noncitizens the ability to vote creates endless opportunities for fraud, which will counteract restoring faith in the American election process. This is unacceptable. I look forward to seeing our bills pass in both chambers of Congress,\" the lawmaker said. Mr. Palmer's bill passed the House Committee on Administration in November.",

Former Donald Trump -allied lawyers Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro on Thursday stunned users of X, formerly Twitter, with their single-sentence statements that they were obliged to pen after copping plea deals in the Georgia election interference case. “I apologize for my actions in connection with the events in Coffee County,” wrote Powell. “I apologize to the citizens of the State of Georgia and of Fulton County for my involvement in Count 15 of the indictment,” said Chesebro. Advertisement The duo had been charged alongside Trump and 16 others over alleged efforts to overturn Trump’s loss in the state. MSNBC anchor Katie Phang summed up their letters, that were revealed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Thursday, with one word: “Underwhelming.” Responding to Phang, former federal prosecutor Andrew Weissmann wrote: “To be filed under ‘THAT’S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.’” Others agreed: To be filed under \"THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT\" No jail time, eventual expungement of criminal record, and court sign-off on crimes not being of moral turpitude (so can continue to practice law)--all the consequences for engaging in attempted overthrow of US presidential election. https://t.co/O2aL0F0kLr — Andrew Weissmann (weissmann11 on Threads)🌻 (@AWeissmann_) December 14, 2023 Advertisement They should have been required to write it 100 times — MooneyWho (@WiblyWoblyMoony) December 14, 2023 Sidney Powell wrote quite a heartfelt Letter of Apology to comply with her plea agreement.

        "content": "The Australian government has warned that violent acts by Israeli settlers are “terrorising Palestinian communities” in the occupied West Bank, joining with western allies to denounce an “environment of near complete impunity”. Two days after voting in favour of a UN general assembly resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, the Australian government has strengthened its objections to violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. Australia outlined the stance in a joint statement with 13 other countries plus the European Union issued on Friday. The group, which also includes France, Spain, Ireland, Canada and the UK, called on Israel to “take immediate and concrete steps to tackle record high settler violence in the occupied West Bank”. How American citizens lead rise of ‘settler violence’ on Palestinian lands Read more “Since the start of October, settlers have committed more than 343 violent attacks, killing 8 Palestinian civilians, injuring more than 83, and forcing 1026 Palestinians from their homes,” the joint statement said. “We strongly condemn the violent acts committed by extremist settlers, which are terrorising Palestinian communities.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The US took a rare punitive step against Israel last week by announcing visa bans for individuals implicated in violence in the West Bank, a policy replicated by the UK government on Thursday . To date, the Australian government has been silent on whether it would implement a similar policy but it has conveyed its concerns directly to the Israeli government. The foreign minister, Penny Wong , tweeted on Friday evening: “Australia has joined with more than a dozen partners to express our grave concern about the record number of attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank.” The Guardian view on the West Bank: the suffering of Palestinians extends beyond Gaza | Editorial Read more The joint statement said the rise in extremist settler violence against Palestinians was “unacceptable”. “Israel, as the occupying power, must protect the Palestinian civilian population in the West Bank. Those responsible for the violence must be brought to justice,” the statement said. “Israel’s failure to protect Palestinians and prosecute extremist settlers has led to an environment of near complete impunity in which settler violence has reached unprecedented levels. This undermines security in the West Bank and the region and threatens prospects for a lasting peace.” The statement acknowledged the Israeli government had promised to take actions against violent perpetrators, but called for “proactive” steps to protect communities. “Words are important, but must now be translated into action,” it said. A spokesperson for the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said: “The Palestinian civilian population in the West Bank must be protected, and perpetrators of any violence held to account for their actions.” The Israeli ambassador to Australia, Amir Maimon, confirmed last week that the Australian government had used “official channels” to raise the issue of settler attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank. How Israeli settler violence is forcing Palestinians to flee their homes – video “I disapprove of [such attacks] and I know that my government will do its utmost in order to bring those who are violating the law and Palestinian rights behind bars,” Maimon told Guardian Australia last week . skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the Australian government is aligned with most countries in agreeing that settlements are illegal under international law. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws show Dfat recommended earlier this year that Australia “refer publicly to Israeli settlement activity as illegal under international law”. Dfat officials pointed to UN security council resolution 2334, which reaffirmed “that the establishment by Israel of settlements in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law”. That prompted Wong to announce in August : “The Australian government is strengthening its opposition to settlements by affirming they are illegal under international law and a significant obstacle to peace.” The joint statement issued by Australia and other countries on Friday reiterated “our position that Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are illegal under international law and remind Israel of its obligations under international law”. The statement specifically mentioned Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which includes that an occupying power “shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies”. The signatories also included Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.",

        "description": "For the first time in almost 75 years, beavers were released into California waters as a part of conservation efforts by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and Maidu Summit Consortium.",
        "content": "December 15, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread by Emma Hall, The Sacramento Bee For the first time in almost 75 years, beavers were released into California waters as a part of conservation efforts by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and Maidu Summit Consortium. A family of seven beavers swam their way through Tásmam Koyóm, a tribal community in Plumas County that are ancestral land to the Mountain Maidu people. This new family will join a \"single resident beaver in the valley\" with the goal to re-establish a breeding population, according to the CDFW. Ben Cunningham, chairman of the Maidu Summit Consortium, said the valley had beavers years ago, but due to pioneer interference, the population disappeared. \"It's good to have them back home again,\" said Cunningham, who is also Northeastern Maidu. \"The beavers are back where they belong.\" Not only will these beavers be important for local tribes and groups like the Maidu Summit Consortium, but broader conservation efforts. Beavers are what CDFW Environmental Program Manager Valerie Cook called \"keystone species.\" Beavers, she said, provide a significant ecological benefit to their landscape, species around them, and help build up climate change resilience. Removal can be detrimental to a local ecosystem. \"There's a cascade of effects where you see (once beavers are gone), other species are no longer there,\" Cook said. \"Beavers really play a critical ecosystem management role.\" Described as an \"ecosystem restoration tool,\" Cook said the beavers are vital to engineering aquatic habitats. Having beavers in the area can lead to increased groundwater recharge and increased seasonal water flow. Rather than spend millions of dollar on ecosystem restoration efforts that include mimicry like beaver dam analogs, beavers can do their part. \"This new opportunity to have beavers translocated into restoration efforts is truly a nature-based solution where we can bring them in and just let them do the work. Let them do their thing,\" Cook said. \"Let them play their role in the ecosystem. The CDFW said their efforts will continue in the spring on the Tule River Reservation, which is located in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains. Charlton H. Bonhom, the director of CDFW, said this project is the product of leadership from local tribal communities. If it weren't for communities like the Tule River Tribe of California or other tribes, he said, an effort like this wouldn't be possible. \"We would not be here without the Tule River Tribe of California who have been out front advocating for these actions for years, tribes around the state like (the) Karuk, and, of course, Maidu Summit Consortium leaders,\" Bonham said in a news release. \"The future looks much better because of these leaders.\" 2023 The Sacramento Bee.

        "description": "B cells are prolific producers of antibodies, but for the first time, scientists have modified them to make other proteins to counteract a serious genetic disease.",
        "content": "Our B cells help prevent us from getting sick. Their job is to make antibodies, immune system proteins that fight off viruses and other foreign invaders. And they make a lot of antibodies—thousands of them every second. What if these antibody factories could be harnessed to make other things the body needs? That’s the idea behind a trial launched by Seattle-based biotech company Immusoft. The company announced today that its scientists have genetically programmed a patient’s B cells and put them back in his body in an effort to treat disease. It’s the first time engineered B cells have been tested in a person. The patient has a genetic disorder known as mucopolysaccharidosis type I, or MPS I. His body doesn’t produce an essential enzyme that helps to break down long-chain sugars inside cells. Without this enzyme, these sugars build up in the eyes, heart, bones, and elsewhere. The effects are life-threatening. Patients have cloudy eyes, respiratory problems, cognitive issues, and enlarged organs. Those with the most severe form of the disease die in childhood. Others may live to their twenties or thirties. Patients are currently treated with weekly infusions of the enzyme their body lacks. The therapy must be given for the entirety of a patient’s life. Typically, a gene called IDUA provides instructions for making this enzyme, but people with MPS I have a mutation in this gene. Immusoft’s aim is to override this problem by prompting a person’s B cells to make the enzyme instead. B cells appealed to Immusoft because of their ability to pump out lots of proteins. If a person’s B cells could provide a continuous supply of this enzyme, it could eliminate the need for regular infusions. Sean Ainsworth, CEO of Immusoft, says the initial patient is doing well after receiving the experimental therapy in mid-November. “So far, so good,” he says. Researchers at the company collected the patient’s B cells using a machine that removes blood, separates out a particular component, then returns the rest to circulation. There are billions of B cells in the body; Immusoft uses only a portion. “The body is constantly regenerating and producing new B cells,” Ainsworth says. To get the B cells to produce the missing enzyme in addition to antibodies, scientists had to add new genetic instructions to them in the lab. They packaged those instructions into a transposon, a DNA sequence that can naturally integrate into a cell’s genome using a cut-and-paste mechanism. Several commercially available therapies involve genetically engineering a patient’s cells outside the body to treat disease. A newly approved treatment for sickle cell disease uses Crispr to edit a patient’s blood-forming stem cells. And a type of “living drug” known as CAR-T cell therapy supercharges a patient’s T cells against cancer. No current therapies use a person’s B cells. “It seems to me it was the obvious thing to move from T cells to B cells,” says Abla Creasey, vice president of therapeutics development at the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, which has awarded $12,000 in grants to Immusoft. She says B cells represent an exciting new strategy to treat disorders in which the body doesn’t make enough of a certain protein or enzyme. The field is still new, says David Rawlings, an immunologist at Seattle Children’s Hospital who is working on engineered B cell therapies. That’s in part because B cells proved more difficult to manipulate than other types of cells. His lab is using Crispr to modify B cells, and he cofounded a company, Be Biopharma, to further develop them. “The uses are really broad because you can think of them as a drug-secreting platform that lasts for a long time,” Rawlings says. Existing engineered cell therapies have shown miraculous effects, but they come with downsides. In the case of the Crispr treatment, patients first undergo chemotherapy, which can cause hair loss, nausea, and other unpleasant side effects. After treatment, they must then stay in the hospital for weeks while their edited stem cells take up residence in the bone marrow. With CAR-T cell therapy, serious immune or nervous system effects can occur, so patients must be monitored in the hospital. By contrast, Immusoft’s engineered B cells are given as an IV infusion in an outpatient procedure, Ainsworth says. Paul Orchard, the doctor running the trial at the University of Minnesota Medical School, says the original plan was to treat children with the disease. “It’s easier to prevent complications than it is to reverse them after they’ve already happened,” he says. “If you can identify kids and intervene relatively early in life, they’re more likely to get benefits.” However, the US Food and Drug Administration has limited the team to working with adults initially, until the therapy is shown to be safe. He says one concern the FDA has with engineering B cells is the possibility that they could turn cancerous, giving rise to lymphoma or leukemia. The transposon system Immunosoft uses inserts the new genetic material in a random fashion, so Orchard says there’s a theoretical risk that it could do so near a cancer-causing gene. This is also a known risk with current CAR-T cell therapies, which use viruses to deliver new genetic material to cells. Scientists can’t precisely control where in the genome viruses drop off their payload. Immusoft’s initial trial is meant to test safety of its engineered B cell approach, so patients will continue receiving their usual enzyme infusions for now. The next step will be to take patients off the infusions to see whether the modified B cells are doing what they’re supposed to do. Orchard says they’ll measure enzyme levels in the blood and also look for improvement in patients’ symptoms, including movement and heart function. One big question investigators are hoping to answer is how long the engineered B cells stick around in the body. Some B cells last for decades, Orchard says. “We’ll have to see. Obviously, it would be better if it's a definitive therapy and a one-time administration.”",

        "description": "Highly caffeinated drinks have become a cultural staple. But following a death allegedly related to Panera Bread’s Charged Lemonade, has our collective obsession with energy drinks become unsafe?",
        "content": "Whenever he visited his local branch of Panera Bread in Fleming Island, Florida, it was Dennis Brown’s habit to order three drinks in a row. On September 28, and again on October 2, and the 4th, 5th, 7th, and 9th—the day Brown died—his drink of choice was Panera Bread’s Charged Lemonade. A 20-ounce serving of Charged Lemonade contains 260 milligrams of caffeine, while the 30-ounce cup has 390 mg—close to the US Food and Drug Administration’s recommended daily limit. It isn’t known which size Brown, 46, consumed on October 9, but after finishing his dinner, he left the American fast casual restaurant and suffered a fatal cardiac arrest on a nearby sidewalk shortly after. A wrongful-death lawsuit filed against Panera Bread on behalf of Brown’s family states that he usually drank iced tea, root beer, or water and was allegedly unaware that Charged Lemonade contains caffeine, as the lawsuit says it wasn’t advertised as an energy drink. Elizabeth Crawford, the attorney representing Brown’s family, has claimed the drink is “a wolf in sheep’s clothing.” Panera Bread says it’s not to blame. “Panera Bread expresses our deep sympathy to Mr. Brown’s family. Based on our investigation, we believe his unfortunate passing was not caused by one of the company’s products,” Jessica Hesselschwerdt, senior director of public relations at Panera Bread, told WIRED. Hesselschwerdt says the case against the company is “without merit,” that Panera “stands firmly by the safety of our products,” and that Charged Lemonade contains “the same amount of caffeine per ounce as a dark roast coffee.” That may be true. But while health bodies advise that consuming caffeine is OK, as long as we don’t overdo it, in recent years caffeinated drinks have been getting bigger and stronger—so much so that regulators are stepping in. Panera Bread’s drinks aren’t the only ones to have raised concern. In January 2022, the internet found itself in a frenzy over Prime , an energy drink developed by YouTube stars turned boxers Logan Paul and KSI. Sold in neon-colored cans and advertising zero sugar and vegetarian-friendly ingredients, the brand was an immediate hit among the influencer’s combined—and often very young—40 million Instagram followers, who posted their own viral videos of themselves frantically searching for cans of the drink. By July, US Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer had requested an FDA investigation into the brand, claiming parents were unwittingly serving their children a “cauldron of caffeine” when they purchased the drink. (Prime contains 200 mg of caffeine per 12 ounces—roughly equal to two cans of Red Bull plus a cup of coffee.) In response to Schumer’s calls, the company released a public statement claiming that “Prime energy … contains a comparable amount of caffeine to other top-selling energy drinks.” The drink is still for sale in the US and UK, but it was one of six energy drinks recalled in Canada earlier this year, with new legislation outlawing drinks containing more than 180 mg of caffeine in a single serving. In a video after the announcement, Paul said that the drinks are compliant with each country’s specific regulations, claiming, “The crazy part about that is, we don’t even distribute Prime Energy in Canada.” Lithuania, Latvia, Turkey, and Poland have also implemented a general ban on the sale of energy drinks to under-18s, with a UK government ban consultation stalling during the pandemic. These moves are a response to a modern trend—the rise of stronger and stronger drinks—but also part of a pattern that dates back over a century. The US Department of Agriculture voiced worries about the excessive amounts of caffeine in Coca-Cola as early as 1909. The US Pure Food and Drug Act was amended in 1912, adding caffeine to the list of “habit-forming” substances that should be clearly announced on food labels. As a result, Coke cut its caffeine levels in half. Today, Coca-Cola would barely register as an energy drink, containing 34 mg of caffeine per 12-ounce serving. (Diet Coke is slightly more caffeinated, at 46 mg per 12 ounces.) Some same-size caffeinated drinks available today contain 300 to 400 mg . “Energy drinks are safe in the same way that a doughnut is safe—one every now and again is fine, but eating too many will exceed recommended intake for calories, sugar, and fat,” says nutrition therapist and author Ian Marber . Marber explains that caffeine has a similar chemical structure to adenosine, a substance that is part of the process of creating energy, and acts like a neurotransmitter in the brain. “In essence, adenosine promotes sleep, but metabolites in caffeine prevent it from doing its job, promoting alertness in place,” he explains. “This in turn triggers the adrenal glands to produce adrenaline and cortisol, both of which make us feel alert and capable.” The effects can last for around four hours and can be useful in small doses. But exceed the limits and you might experience anxiety, fatigue, and interrupted sleep patterns. “What makes a substance toxic is the dose,” says Alex Ruani, a doctoral researcher at University College London and chief science educator at the Health Sciences Academy . Coffee is packed with caffeine—66 mg for a “tall” Americano or latte at Starbucks—but “most energy drinks have exorbitant amounts of caffeine, ranging from 60 milligrams to 200 milligrams plus,” she says. “The FDA and its European equivalent, the EFSA , both agree that 400 milligrams of caffeine is a safe daily limit. But here’s the caveat: Consuming this much caffeine in one go could be fatal, especially when consumed for the first time .” In fact, the EFSA advises a single intake of no more than 200 mg of caffeine (around 3 mg per kilogram of body weight) and that the 400 mg limit be split into smaller intakes across the day. As well as containing vast amounts of caffeine, the added ingredients in some energy drinks can also be harmful. “Energy drinks often contain other stimulants like B vitamins, L-carnitine, L-theanine, and glucuronolactone,” says Ruani. “When combined, drinkers are faced with a potentially hazardous cocktail that can upset several body systems, including the brain and the heart.” It’s also possible to become addicted to them. “Both sugar and caffeine have addictive properties,” says Ruani. The popularity of energy drinks has been on the rise for decades—and much of their success rests not on their sugary, stimulating formulations but on their marketing. Lucozade (then called Glucozade), perhaps the first drink that would be deemed an energy drink by modern standards, launched in 1927. But it wasn’t until the rise of Red Bull in 1987 that energy drinks began their modern associations—first with extreme sports and then gaming. Energy drinks were no longer just a health tonic, as once advertised, but an essential lifestyle component. Red Bull, which sold more than 11 billion cans in 2022, and Monster Energy are the two leading energy drinks in the United States, with Celsius, Bang Energy, and Rockstar rounding out the most popular choices. Red Bull is also the leading energy drink in the UK, generating £349 million ($445 million) in sales in 2023, well ahead of its nearest competitor, Monster, at £289 million. Worldwide, the energy drinks market is set to be worth $108.4 billion by 2031, up from $45.8 billion (£35.9 billion) in 2020. This acceleration coincides with another marketing pivot—moving into the world of influencers. According to influencer marketing analytics site Tribe Dynamics , in 2021 brands including Bang Energy, GFuel, and Monster “raced ahead on social media by winning over distinct content creator communities.” They did this through three main channels: TikTok influencers, online gamers, and sponsored athletes. “Marketing to the gaming sector is a growing opportunity, with huge events all over the world,” says Vhari Russell, founder of The Food Marketing Experts . “This was a great way to grow throughout lockdown, when more people were gaming.” But social problems have arisen alongside this. “The biggest drinkers of energy drinks are adolescents,” says Ruani. “In the UK and Europe , as many as seven in 10 teens consume them, and two in 10 children.” Ruani points to evidence of multiple hospitalizations and deaths of children and adults that have been attributed to the consumption of energy drinks. “It’s outrageous that energy-drink manufacturers deny targeting kids and youngsters,” she says. “The proof is on the can: many displaying colorful designs and childhood flavors like ‘bubble gum’ and ‘ice pop.’ Couple that with the hype sparked by TikTok influencers, and it’s no wonder that kids and teens are obsessed with them.” Dan Tai ( @dantai ), an online coach and fitness model with 824,000 Instagram followers, drinks about four energy drinks per week and markets them on his page. Chelsie Cahoon ( @thesoberraver ) works as a promo model for an energy drink brand called Celsius, despite limiting herself to just three energy drinks per year. “I never liked drinking them because of how much sugar a lot of them have,” she says. Both believe the onus is on the brands to warn consumers of the dangers, though Cahoon adds that consumers should carry out “additional research” into what they consume. In the US, the FDA has not imposed specific restrictions or requirements on the sale or labeling of energy drinks, but the American Beverage Association’s Guidance for the Responsible Labeling and Marketing of Energy Drinks does lay out some rules, including that energy-drink packaging must declare the total amount of caffeine per drink, that they cannot be marketed at children, and that they cannot be labeled as dietary supplements. Adherence to these rules is voluntary, however, and 5 percent of energy drinks sold in the US don't follow them. And given current rates of energy-drink consumption among teenagers and children both in the US and UK, the efficacy of such rules is questionable. Given all of this, the most recent transition in the energy drink market can be seen as the most alarming: their transmogrification into health drinks, with brands such as Tenzing, Brio Yerba Mate, and PerfectTed flooding supermarket shelves. “The changes we see in the energy drinks industry is a result of wider health and wellness trends,” says Rachel Yon Choi, behavioral analyst at brand consultancy Canvas8 . “While people still want energy-boosting drinks, they want that boost from a source that’s beneficial to their body and well-being. They’re moving away from sugar, synthetic, and ultra-processed ingredients to seek out cleaner, ‘better for you,’ and lower-calorie products.” Huib van Bockel, founder of Tenzing, took inspiration for his brand from “Sherpa tea” (typically organic black tea, with added yak butter and salt, making it rich in electrolytes, fat, and natural caffeine), as well as Tenzing Norgay, who along with Edmund Hillary became one of the first people to summit Everest in 1953. With sherpas known for seemingly superhuman feats in oxygen-depleted “death zones,” the health connotations are clear. “We have the same amount of natural caffeine as a cup of coffee and 60 percent less sugar than a traditional energy drink,” says Van Bockel. “Because of the low sugar levels and our natural blend of caffeine, L-theanine, electrolytes, and vitamin C, you get the uplift but not the crash,” he says. Marber, while not specifically addressing Tenzing, is clear that adding in “healthy” ingredients doesn’t magically turn an energy drink into a health tonic. “There’s nothing wrong with some caffeine and sugar, but having lower amounts than other offerings doesn’t make it ‘healthy’ any more than adding nutrients does,” he says. Again, it’s down to consumer habits. “I don’t think there are unhealthy foods, more unhealthy habits. So an average quality drink here and there is fine, more often isn’t,” Marber says. Ultimately, Russell believes that empowering consumers to make better choices could be the solution to curbing potentially dangerous caffeine consumption. “It’s informing them as to why a cup of coffee or tea might be better than an energy drink,” she says. Panera Bread has tried this. On October 30, the brand added prominent warnings to its Charged Lemonade in stores and online, reading: “Use in moderation. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR children, people sensitive to caffeine, pregnant or nursing women.” At the time of writing, three “Charged” drinks remain available on Panera’s website, including Blood Orange Charged Splash (150–219 mg of caffeine) and Strawberry Lemon Mint Charged Lemonade (158–237 mg). And the buzz around these and other highly colored, high-power drinks is showing no signs of slowing down.",

        "description": "Hominid cannibalism, “dark stars,” the secrets of Earth’s core and more tantalizing findings will require more evidence before scientists can confirm them as fact.",
        "content": "By From ancient cannibalism to stars made of dark matter, 2023 delivered several scientific claims that could shake up their fields — if they shape up to be true. Early life on Earth may have gotten a boost from giant volcanic eruptions. A new look at debris from 10 eruptions millions of years ago suggests they ( ). The eruptions could have triggered fierce lightning that ripped apart molecular nitrogen, freeing nitrogen atoms to bond with other elements and form molecules useful to life — including nitrate. The same process may have happened billions of years ago, some scientists say, producing ingredients for early life. Scientists will need to account for the different chemical makeup of primordial Earth’s atmosphere to bolster that claim. Purported tool marks on a 1.45-million-year-old fossilized leg offer , researchers contend ( ). The marks on the bone, found in Kenya, could have been made by some unidentified hominid using a stone tool to carve muscle away from the shin of another hominid. But a few bone nicks do not cannibal table scraps make, some paleoanthropologists say. A handful of galaxies from the very early universe are , data from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope suggest ( ). The hefty galaxies not only challenge the idea that matter clumped together slowly over the universe’s lifetime, but also hint at some unknown way to fast-track galaxy formation. But the galaxies’ weights and distances must be confirmed with more detailed analyses of their light before astronomers rewrite cosmic history. The thymus may not be inconsequential for ( ). This immune system organ between the lungs is most active in childhood and withers with age, so it is often considered expendable in adulthood. In a study of more than 2,000 adults who had chest surgery, however, researchers reported that removing the thymus gland was associated with higher rates of death and of cancer within the next few years. Why thymus removal might be harmful remains unclear. Honoring the dead may not be unique to big-brained hominids like and Neandertals. , which lived around the same time as early but had an orange-sized brain, in an underground South African cave, a group of researchers claims ( ). Other experts remain unconvinced, though. The supposedly buried bodies, which predate the earliest evidence of . and Neandertal burials by 160,000 years, could have fallen through cave shafts or been washed by water into natural depressions in cave floors, skeptics say. Separate studies both based on earthquake data are shaking up geologists’ concept of Earth’s heart. The solid inner core not only rotates but also appears to relative to the mantle and crust every few decades ( ). The inner core may also have ( ). Other data, however, hint that the inner core reverses every few years or does not rotate at all. And the supposed discovery of the innermost core hinges on a type of seismic wave that bounces around Earth’s interior, becoming weaker and more difficult to detect with every bounce. Thankfully, whatever is going on down there does not seem to endanger life on the surface. The James Webb Space Telescope may have spotted stars made of dark matter — the unidentified stuff that makes up most matter in the cosmos ( ). So-called dark stars are so far hypothetical, but JWST giving off the kind of light expected from such stars. If they exist, dark stars could shed new light on star formation and the nature of dark matter. However, the pinpricks of light in JWST’s field of view could also come from normal stars, so astronomers will need more detailed data to tease out the objects’ true nature.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked preprint trusted source proofread by Tomasz Nowakowski , Phys.org By analyzing the early data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), an international team of astronomers has identified 95 new extremely metal-poor galaxies at a low redshift. The finding is detailed in a paper published December 1 on the pre-print server arXiv . Extremely metal-poor galaxies (XMPGs) are the ones with metallicity below 0.1 of the solar metallicity. Given that these galaxies are chemically unevolved, they can serve as excellent laboratories for investigating the chemical evolution theories of galaxies and studying the physical processes in the early stages of their evolution. Although XMPGs are assumed to be quite common at high redshift, they are difficult to observe due to their low masses. Therefore, astronomers are interested in the observations of local XMPGs at low redshift, as they are perceived as possible analogs of primeval high-redshift young galaxies of this type in terms of mass and metallicity. Now, a group of astronomers led by Hu Zou of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China, has obtained a large sample of XMPGs based on the early data from DESI. \"This work focuses on the analysis of DESI early data, including the Early Data Release (EDR; DESI Collaboration et al. 2023b), the detection of XMPGs and exploration of their mass-metallicity relation,\" the researchers wrote in the paper. All in all, the team first selected 1,623 star-forming galaxies with significant oxygen emission lines detection. From this sample, they identified 223 extremely metal-poor galaxies at redshifts below 1.0. Finally, they confirmed 95 of them as bona fide XMPGs, while the 128 galaxies remain XMPG candidates. Most of the XMPGs reported in the study were found at a low redshift of below 0.3 and turned out to be dwarf galaxies—with stellar masses not exceeding 1 billion solar masses . The most metal-poor galaxy in the sample, designated DESIJ150535.89+314639.4, has an oxygen abundance at a level of only 1/34 of that of the sun, has a stellar mass of about 15 million solar masses, and its star-forming rate was calculated to be 0.22 solar masses per year. The astronomers noted that preliminary imaging examination of the two most metal-poor galaxies discovered from their sample revealed two different morphologies. This suggests different evolution and physical origins; however, further studies are required in order to confirm this hypothesis. Summing up the results, the authors of the paper underlined that the extremely metal-poor galaxies detected by them are possibly low- redshift analogs of galaxies at high redshifts reaching 6.0 or even beyond. Therefore, they could be excellent objects for exploring the universe at its early stages of evolution.

        "content": "December 15, 2023 report This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked preprint trusted source proofread by Tomasz Nowakowski , Phys.org Astronomers from the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) and elsewhere, report the discovery of a new 'warm Jupiter' exoplanet orbiting a rapidly rotating F-type star. The newfound alien world, designated TOI-4641 b could be nearly four times as massive as Jupiter. The finding was detailed in a paper published December 7 on the pre-print server arXiv . In general, warm Jupiters are gas giant planets with orbital periods between 10 and 200 days. This makes them challenging targets for transit detection, and radial velocity follow-up studies, compared to their shorter-orbit counterparts known as hot Jupiters. Now, a group of astronomers led by CfA's Allyson Bieryla has found a new exoplanet of this type. Using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which is conducting an all-sky survey searching for transiting extrasolar worlds, they identified a transit signal in the light curve of TOI-4641—a bright and rapidly rotating F-star (with a projected rotational velocity of approximately 86.3 km/s). The planetary nature of this signal was confirmed by follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations. \"A candidate exoplanet orbiting TOI-4641 with a period of 22.1d was identified in light curves including data through Sector 43 in both SPOC and QLP pipelines,\" the researchers wrote in the paper. The newfound planet has a radius of about 0.73 Jupiter radii and its maximum mass was calculated to be 3.87 Jupiter masses. The observations indicate that TOI-4641 b orbits its host star every 22.09 days at a well-aligned orbit, at a distance of some 0.173 AU from it. TOI-4641 b is therefore among the longest period planets, to be thoroughly characterized, that orbits a hot rapidly rotating star. The parent star TOI-4641 (also known as TIC 436873727), located some 286 light years away, has a radius of about 1.72 solar radii and is approximately 41% more massive than the sun. The star is estimated to be 2.69 billion years old, has a metallicity at a level of -0.09, and its effective temperature was found to be 6,560 K. The authors of the paper underlined that long-period exoplanets like TOI-4641 b could be crucial for testing mechanisms that induce primordial misalignment in planetary systems , given that at such orbital distances, star-planet tidal interactions are assumed to be too weak to modify the orbital obliquity. \"Testing these predictions motivate full characterizations of planets in long-period orbits about early-type stars,\" the scientists concluded. All in all, Bieryla's team proposes a few mechanisms behind such misalignment, including chaotic accretion, magnetic warping, or changes to the spin axes of early-type stars, as well as stellar or planetary companions during the primordial phase of formation.

        "content": "On the latest episode of 83 Weeks, Eric Bischoff talked about the success that WWE has found over the last year, trust the company has with CM Punk, and more. You can check out some highlights below: On the most crucial thing behind WWE’s boom in popularity: ‘Discipline, structured story and character development. And I would disagree to a degree with the person who posed that question. I think the Bloodline storyline, which started long before Vince left and was getting very exciting long before Vince left, Vince was very much a part of that storyline. And perhaps in some ways, at some points, he held it back. Maybe it could have gotten bigger, faster, stronger sooner. But Vince was very, very much a part of that. Vince’s [McMahon] commitment to Roman Reigns; let’s go back now three, four, five years. Vince was determined to get Roman Reigns over. So people could say, ‘Oh yeah, as soon as Vince left, everything got better.’ It’s not a very realistic perspective. “Yeah, I think things have gotten better better since Vince left. Only because I think the creative process is now much more efficient. I think your writing team can now, with confidence, start laying out stories without knowing in the back of their mind, in the front of the mind that there’s about a 75% chance, even though Vince would say, ‘Yeah, that looks good’ on Friday on the plane, going to Raw on Monday morning he might just tear the whole thing up and start over again. That’s a very, very uneasy feeling if you’re a creative person. And then you get to the building and you’re going to know that you’re going to have two hours to write a brand new show from top to bottom that has to be approved. Not only does it have to be approved, if there is a spelling error in the first draft of what you think you want to do and you want to present to Vince with only two hours before show time. But if he sees a typo or poor grammar, there’s a chance he’ll just rip the whole thing up without the rest of it, and ask you to go redo it. And let you know what he thinks of your grammar and your spelling on your way out the door. That’s not efficient creative. And it takes a creative person so outside of their game and the train of thought, the frame of mind, the vibe they have to be in, it’s just it’s a different world being in creative. And to have that kind of instability throughout the entire process doesn’t get you to the best creativity by any stretch of the imagination.” On whether WWE trusts Punk enough to make him World Champion: “You know, I don’t know the culture that exists today. I knew the culture that existed last time I was there. I was in — and I’m going to be very vague, but I’m doing it intentionally out of respect, so please accept that. But I was in a meeting, Punk’s name came up, and all of the key decision-makers in WWE at that time were in that meeting. And that name came up, and the conversation lasted all of three minutes. And that was the end of that. That was the culture then. I don’t know what the culture is now. You know, Triple H used to work for me, Paul Levesque worked for WCW before he went to WWE but I never got to know Paul then, a couple of conversations with him really. Even when I worked with him when I first went to WWE as a talent, very little conversation with Paul Levesque. When I worked there in 2019 for a cup of coffee, I interfaced with Paul Levesque more than I ever had in the previous 20 years. But even then, I didn’t really get to know him. So I don’t know what Paul thinks, and what his tolerance is for situations like CM Punk brings. “I suspect that — two things. One is, I don’t think CM Punk’s going to even try to exert the kind of — I’m going to call it bullying, right? He ain’t throwing his weight around backstage at WWE anywhere. The company is so much bigger than him, there’s no room for that there, and nobody will tolerate it. And I think because of history, people will be watching very carefully how Phil Brooks as an individual handles himself professionally behind — because there’s no question the CM Punk character is viable and valuable. The question mark is, is Phil Brooks the professional that he needs to be to make it work? I suspect he probably is. I suspect that, I hope, that Phil Brooks is going, ‘Wow, this is a hell of an opportunity. I can write the end of my own story. I can retire from this business on a positive note. And oh by the way, I can pocket millions and millions of dollars along the way. But I gotta be a team player.’ That’s what I hope, and that’s what I think is probably going on: he’s a smart guy. He has to be a smart guy to get where he is right now. But I do think that there’s probably eyes on Phil Brooks and the way he conducts himself. But I don’t know where the guardrails are, but I don’t think it’s going to be an issue, I really don’t. I said this before he even went there when speculation was, ‘Do you think he’ll go?’ I said, ‘Sure, he’ll go. If he has the opportunity, he’d be crazy not to.’ But he’s not going to get away — there is no CM Punk running amok backstage. No one’s going to get choked out. No one’s going to be in fear for their life. You’re not going to have the craziness and the mishegoss going on backstage and the drama that went on in AEW because it’s an entirely different environment.” If you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit 83 Weeks with an h/t to 411mania.com for the transcription.",

        "content": "Neil Magny isn’t typically one to get caught up in trash talk. The UFC welterweight division’s all-time leader in wins last fought in a short-notice affair at UFC 292 in August. Magny filled in for his fellow veteran Geoff Neal to face rising undefeated Irish star Ian Machado Garry . Unfortunately for the 36-year-old, he was dealt an 11th career loss in his 39 outings when Garry won a one-sided unanimous decision. In the very brief build-up to the bout, Garry (13-0) targeted Magny personally, and specifically went after a comment Magny made towards Garry, saying he’d give him “a whooping that you give your son.” Garry ran with it and went on to call Magny an abusive father and state how such contexts shouldn’t be used and are never funny. Since then, Garry has pulled out of his upcoming fight at UFC 296 that was scheduled for tomorrow night against Vicente Luque . “The Future” has cited pneumonia as the reason for his withdrawal . The timing is brutal for Garry within the community, not only with it coming after his verbal attack on Magny, but drama has followed the Irishman in the form of a gym departure and a resurfacing of a controversial book published by his wife Layla Anna-Lee. Therefore, the online backlash has to have made Garry already hesitant about his public obligations before his fight was canceled. Despite their history, Magny isn’t at all basking in the fallout. “I’m fortunate now that like the majority of that stuff is behind me,” Magny told Middle Easy . “That didn’t affect me too drastically when it comes to my family life and that kind of thing. But, it’s unfortunate to see someone’s personal life be drug up the way his life has been drug up and all the stuff that he has to go through currently. I wouldn’t wish that on anybody, especially when you consider the entire family dynamic and all the people are involved in there. “Like yeah, him and his wife may have whatever going on, but at the end of the day, regardless of what’s going on, they share a child together. That child deserves the right to grow up knowing he has two loving parents or whatever. Again, all this stuff drug out into the media, out in the open, that kind of thing — I don’t think anyone is deserving of that regardless what they may or may not have done to me. I’m not gonna sit back and necessarily take joy in seeing that play out with somebody.” Garry’s win over Magny was his biggest to date and his sixth straight in the octagon. It’s unknown at this time whether or not the matchup with Luque will be rebooked as Kevin Holland has teased the possibility of taking Garry’s place. Magny, on the other hand, will look to rebound sooner rather than later when he faces Mike Mallott at UFC 297 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on January 20. Ideally, “The Haitian Sensation” will one day score a rematch with Garry, but he won’t hold his breath. “If I’m being honest, it’s unfortunate,” Magny continued to reflect on his brief saga with Garry. “Having gone through what I got gone through based off of some of the statements and antics that Ian Garry said during fight week, it definitely caused some personal turbulence in my life, so to speak. But at the end of the day, I have to take accountability for the things that left my mouth and take accountability for the words that left my mouth. I definitely made statements that he was able to spin and play out in a different way than what I have intended to. “At the end of the day, that’s on me. I was the one who made those statements, made those statements publicly. How someone else perceived them or spun them — that’s outta my control, but I kind of gave him that opportunity to be able to do so. I have to own that fact and live with it, so to speak.” Finale.

        "content": "Growing up in western North Dakota, Angelo Vournas developed a passion for archery hunting in the Badlands at an early age. “My mom would call into school at noon and say I was sick, so I’d go down to the Badlands my senior year,” said Vournas, who graduated from high school in Williston, attended college at UND and now lives in Minot. “I spent a lot of time down there.” Then as now, the vast amount of public land available in the Badlands of western North Dakota and the potential for shooting a trophy mule deer buck with his bow were big attractions, Vournas says.

You can get off trail and not have to worry about people, typically.” ADVERTISEMENT The “not have to worry about people” part of the attraction has started to change in recent years as more people discover the Badlands and what it has to offer. That includes not only deer hunting, but sharp-tailed grouse hunting, hiking, biking and other outdoor recreational activities. But it’s the deer hunting pressure that has had perhaps the greatest impact on the experience, Vournas and others say. It’s gotten to the point, Vournas says, where he doesn’t even hunt the September archery opener anymore, “just because of the amount of people that are down there.” Many of those people, he says, are hunters, often from out of state, who may not understand how to pursue deer in the rugged Badlands environment. Vournas prefers the “spot-and-stalk” technique, glassing the horizon with binoculars in hopes of spotting a mule deer bedded down and then making a slow, stealthy pursuit that can take hours. “A lot of people just go walking around with their bows thinking they’re going to shoot a mule deer,” he said. “What they don’t realize is that they’re probably not going to shoot a mule deer and they’re screwing it up for everybody else who is trying to (spot) one and then be able to make a stalk on it.” In response to the uptick in Badlands traffic and calls from the public, the North Dakota Game and Fish Department is exploring options for managing the situation. “We’ve been hearing from the public for the last few years a bit more, I would say,” said Bill Haase, assistant wildlife chief for Game and Fish in Bismarck. “Especially from archery hunters. The hunting pressure is taking away from the quality of the hunt. And then from the gun hunters – they’re getting frustrated because it’s more and more difficult to draw that coveted (mule deer) gun tag.” Allocating licenses Game and Fish sets mule deer gun licenses based on population surveys, which gives them the flexibility to adjust tag numbers as necessary, but archery licenses are trickier because the regulations are in state law. North Dakota residents can buy archery tags basically over the counter, allowing them to hunt anywhere in the state and shoot either white-tailed or mule deer. ADVERTISEMENT There’s no limit on the number of whitetail-only bow licenses available to nonresidents, but nonresident “any-deer” archery tags – allowing the harvest of either a mule deer or a whitetail – are limited, by state law, to 15% of the previous year’s mule deer rifle tag allocation. Nonresident archery tags cost $250. It’s a social issue, in part, Haase says, but it’s also becoming a biological issue as the percentage of deer harvested by archery in some Badlands hunting units approaches the percentage of deer taken by gun. “The success rate in archery hunters the last few years has been anywhere from 9% to 15%, so it’s low,” Haase said. “It’s tough to shoot a deer in the Badlands with a bow, but the effort is really high. So, when you have a lot of people doing it, it starts to add up to a meaningful harvest.” Throw in a lower mule deer population, the result of poor fawn production after severe drought in 2021 and consecutive harsh winters in 2022 and 2023, and the issue becomes even more pronounced. Mule deer populations in the Badlands have declined from more than 10 deer per square mile to “probably below six,” Haase said in November during a livestream of the Game and Fish Department’s fall advisory board meeting in Bismarck. In this screen shot, Bill Haase, assistant wildlife chief for the North Dakota Game and Fish Department, discusses hunting issues Tuesday, Nov. 21, 2023, during the Game and Fish Department's District 7 fall Advisory Board meeting in Bismarck. The meeting was livestreamed on the Game and Fish Department website. Contributed / North Dakota Game and Fish Department Fawn production last spring was the lowest ever recorded, “and that’s concerning for us,” Haase told the Herald. “It’s been kind of a tough go here for a while, and our numbers have dropped – our densities are lower out there,” Haase said in an interview. “They’re OK – it’s not like we’re not going to recover from it. They’re down, but not drastically down because we’ve been very conservative with our gun tag allocation.” In 2023, Game and Fish offered 862 nonresident “any deer” bow licenses statewide. In response to the population decline, the department drastically cut mule deer gun licenses in 2023 – 2,250, compared with 5,750 in 2022 – but this year’s nonresident “any deer” bow tag allocation was higher than it should have been, Haase says, because of the state law requiring that nonresident any-deer bow licenses be set at 15% of the previous year’s mule deer gun tag allocation. ADVERTISEMENT Contributed / North Dakota Game and Fish Department Next year, nonresident “any deer” bow tags will “drop dramatically,” Haase said, because fewer mule deer gun licenses were available this year. “It’ll be a big drop (in 2024) because it’s a year delay on that, and so that’s kind of unfortunate,” he said. “We’re not able to be as reactive with that (nonresident “any deer” archery) tag allocation as it should be.” The past three years, Haase says, Game and Fish has expanded its post-hunting season archery surveys in an effort to learn more about where bowhunters are going and whether certain times of archery season are busier than others. “We found it’s busy, and it’s busy throughout the season,” he said. Tackling the issue In an effort to gain even more insight into the Badlands issue, Game and Fish last spring assembled a three-person “Badlands License Working Group,” which included a representative from the North Dakota Bowhunters Association, a representative from the North Dakota Chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers and a certified Pope and Young scorer with ties to landowners and the Mule Deer Foundation. The group met twice in the spring and early summer, said Brock Wahl of Bismarck, co-chairman of the North Dakota Backcountry Hunters and Anglers chapter who was part of the group. Brock Wahl of Bismarck, co-chairman of the North Dakota Chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. Contributed / Backcountry Hunters and Anglers “In those meetings, we went over some of the data that Game and Fish had – what they’re seeing with that data, what they’re hearing from hunters, and some of that is just what’s going on in the rumor mill,” Wahl said. “Is there a lot of people concerned about it, or is it just a few people, or what’s going on – is it rifle hunters, bowhunters, landowners – what’s happening here?” In response to those meetings, Game and Fish contracted with a Colorado firm, HDNR Consulting LLC, to develop a survey, which was sent in September to a random sample of 8,000 North Dakota resident deer hunters. ADVERTISEMENT Out of those 8,000 hunters, more than 4,000 responded, and Game and Fish is in the early stages of analyzing the report, which is about 55 pages long, Haase says. “One of the takeaways was that the majority of people are interested in some type of specific management of these archery licenses,” Haase said. “It’s certainly something that we’re going to look at (for) nonresidents and residents,” in terms of how archery licenses are allocated. One thing’s for sure: Whatever changes ultimately result – if any – won’t be to everyone’s liking. “No matter what we do, I can assure you not everybody will agree with us,” Haase said. “There’s people on each end and everywhere across the middle. And there’s a lot of different ways to go, so it’s tough.” Max Hoefs of Grand Forks, who moved to North Dakota from Minnesota in the early 2000s, says he’s been hunting the Badlands since about 2006 and so far this year has spent about three weeks in the rugged country trying to fill his archery tag. “I fell in love with the Western-type of hunting; the spot-and stalk part of it is a little more challenging than sitting in a tree stand for whitetails,” he said. “Sitting on a nice butte, sitting on a nice hillside with a good pair of binoculars and just enjoying nature and looking for a good mule deer. … That’s how I fell in love with the out-West (style of hunting).” Like other resident archery hunters, Hoefs says he appreciates being able to purchase a license every year. On one hand, Hoefs says, he’d like to see fewer nonresident archery hunters in the Badlands – or perhaps even none – but understands the revenue that nonresident license fees bring to the Game and Fish Department. “I’d be really sad as a North Dakota resident not being able to bow hunt in the state” every year, Hoefs said. “But if it was proven that, ‘Hey, if we do this, if we cut the number of tags back, the deer population (and) the success rate would be better,’ would I be for it? Honestly, I don’t know.” ADVERTISEMENT The broad range of opinions definitely adds to the challenge, says Wahl of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. “Everybody’s got an opinion about what’s going to work and what’s best for them. And I’m no different,” Wahl said. “I have my own biases, and I think the challenging thing for us as a chapter is this is going to be a difficult issue for us to really come out strong in support of one particular idea or concept because, with social issues, you’re going to have a lot of unique and passionate opinions. Everybody has their opinion of what’s best. And so as an organization, it would be very difficult for us to come out really strong in support of something and expect that all of our membership is going to be in unified agreement with that.” What’s next Once Game and Fish has analyzed the survey results, the department will meet in January with the Badlands License Working Group and hold public meetings around the state sometime in February or March to gather additional input, said Haase, the assistant wildlife chief. Whatever regulation changes are implemented for next fall, if any, will have to be included in the proclamation of proposed 2024 big game hunting regulations due at the governor’s office in mid-April, Haase said. Others would require legislative action because they’re in state law. “We don’t have to do everything this year,” he said. “Maybe we’ll implement some things this year and then analyze, see what happens and then adjust accordingly. “I don’t know yet, we’ll see. We haven’t made any determinations.” Change is often difficult, and this process is no different, Wahl said. “What we’re talking about here is changing a really long history of the way things have been done in North Dakota,” Wahl said. “And whether or not there’s going to be a change, I don’t know at this point. But I do think when you’re talking about these hunting traditions, tag allocation and season setting, those are tied to our traditions, and so anytime you’re talking about a change like this, which could affect archery and rifle seasons and how often you get to go hunting with certain weapons, that’s a big deal.

        "description": "Duluth native Jake Willis takes over as the Minnesota DNR's chief pilot.",
        "content": "GRAND RAPIDS — Chris Lofstuen retired from his dream job as a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources pilot last week. Lofstuen, of Duluth Township, had been the DNR’s chief pilot since 2019. He didn’t want to leave his passion for being a flying game warden in the rearview mirror. But he says he feels pretty good about the fact the job is now in the hands of a good cop, a good pilot and a good friend. Duluth native Jake Willis has taken over as the chief DNR pilot, heading the agency’s aviation unit based out of Grand Rapids. Willis, 43, and Lofstuen, 57, have been buddies for years. Jake Willis, the new chief pilot for the Minnesota DNR's aviaton unit, during a patrol flight. Sky wardens like Willis conduct routine patrols and also work with wardens on the ground to locate illegal activities, such as baiting for deer or destroying wetlands, that may be out of view of officers on the ground. Contributed / Jake Willis Willis, an avid outdoorsman, is a Duluth native and Superior High School graduate who went from being a Duluth city (and previously University of Minnesota Duluth) cop to game warden, trading his urban beat for a backwoods patrol. Before accepting the chief pilot job, Willis had patrolled the woods and waters of the Brookston station just outside Duluth since 2018. On the ground, as a fully licensed police officer — as all state conservation officers are — Willis may respond to a drunken driver call one hour, illegal spruce tree cutting the next and then reports of a dead bear struck by a car, all between his contacts with hunters and anglers. ADVERTISEMENT But now he’s also going to be in charge of the DNR’s aviation unit, carrying on a tradition that started in 1947. One of two original Minnesota DNR game warden pilots, John Parker, a World War II veteran who started flying for the DNR in 1947. Parker was stationed in Warroad. Contributed / Minnesota DNR “It’s become a pretty important part of what (DNR) is trying to accomplish,” Lofstuen said of the aviation unit. “Not just natural resource protection and management, but public safety in some pretty remote places.” A broad mission in the air Aviation unit pilots over the years have conducted a huge variety of missions — everything from keeping an eye on hunters and anglers, searching for and rescuing lost or injured people, and even ferrying out dead bodies from hard-to-reach locations. Those historic missions continue today with added duties of stocking fish in remote lakes, monitoring wildfires, conducting aerial surveys for wildlife research — waterfowl, elk, moose, deer, wolves and more. They also conduct surveys of how many anglers — boats in summer, ice houses in winter — are fishing on a given lake on a given day, part of the DNR’s creel survey efforts to determine how much fishing pressure is happening on any given body of water.

While the pilots are officially part of the DNR's law enforcement division, much of their work involves fish and wildlife research. Contributed / Quintin R. Slade / Minnesota DNR “The majority of our time in the air really isn’t for law enforcement. It’s primarily a lot of research work with some public safety mixed in,” Lofstuen noted. But even while working on aerial surveys for wildlife research, DNR warden pilots can help make a bust. From the air, the DNR pilots are able to see things that officers on the ground can’t — like a backhoe illegally altering a stream a mile from the nearest road or a deer hunter with a pile of illegal bait on a big chunk of private property.

While the DNR aviation unit is officially part of the enforcement division, the pilots spend much of their time performing fish, wildlife and other natural resource jobs in the air. Contributed / Minnesota DNR Willis recalls one case early in his DNR career when he was flying with an aviation unit pilot on another mission when they noticed a pile of bright orange pumpkins piled along a field, not far from a deer stand. “Corn and pumpkins show up like a beacon from the air,” Willis noted. “We marked it with a GPS pin and finished what we were doing that day. … And on opening morning (of deer hunting season), I walked in there, much to the guy’s surprise. He couldn’t figure out how I knew the bait was there because I hadn’t even walked over to it yet.” ADVERTISEMENT Subscribers Only Northland Outdoors ALSO READ: Carlton County conservation officer follows in grandfather's footsteps Cloquet native Mikeena Wehr returns home to patrol the same woods and waters that Lee Alderson covered. Oct 20 · By John Myers Some hunters intent on breaking the law will go to great lengths to hide their illicit acts. Some DNR pilots have reported camouflage netting strung over bait piles. Willis and Lofstuen noted that some hunters have even painted white PVC pipe to look like a birch tree, and then filled it with corn so only a small amount comes out the bottom — like an automatic pet or livestock feeder. At night, thieves stealing spruce tops or birch trees off public or private land tend to work in the dark. But DNR pilots generally fly low and slow enough to see whatever doesn’t look quite right on the ground. “If something is happening way back on a piece of private property, they can see that from the air. I could legally walk in there. We have that right. But I’m probably not going to go in unless I’m sure there is something going on,” Willis noted. “When we see it from the air, we know for sure.” Duluth-area Conservation Officer Kipp Duncan said DNR pilots often see things while conducting fish or wildlife surveys that they pass on to wardens on the ground, one cop’s tip to another, that often help in making a case. In other cases, the cooperation is more direct. “In one shining case (using a floodlight or vehicle light to shine deer to shoot at night) I had, they directed me right to the guy who still had the light on and a loaded gun in his hands,” Duncan noted.

He said he loved his previous job as a sex crimes investigator for the Duluth Police Department and was reluctant to leave. But the chance to combine three of his passions with the DNR job — flying, the outdoors and law enforcement — was too good to turn down. Both Lofstuen and Willis have been pilots since they were 18. ADVERTISEMENT Willis received his degree in law enforcement and aviation from Minnesota State University-Mankato. His goal had been to become a commercial airline pilot. But the cost and time it took to train for that job seemed out of reach. Instead, Willis became a cop, first for the University of Minnesota Duluth and then the Duluth Police Department. He slowly left his passion for flying behind. That is until Lofstuen coaxed him into a ride out of the Two Harbors airport on Lofstuen’s private plane. The love of flying “immediately came right back to me when I went up with Chris. I went right out and got current (with his private pilot's license requirements) after that,” Willis said. “I missed it that much and didn't know it.” DNR pilots Jake Willis, left, and Chris Lofstuen at Lofstuen's retirement party in the DNR hangar at the Grand Rapids/Itasca County Airport on Dec. 1. John Myers / Duluth Media Group Lofstuen had dreamed of a career as a corporate pilot flying bigwigs around in Gulfstream jets. That never happened, and instead, the Bloomington, Minnesota, native ended up as a police officer. But he never stopped flying. “Before I wanted to be a cop, I wanted to be a pilot. This job let me do both,” Lofstuen said of his DNR gig. “Once you get into public service like this, it’s a big part of who you are.” In recent years, Willis has been flying part time for DNR in addition to his field station work on the ground. When Lofstuen was forced to retire due to a medical issue that ended his piloting days — after 32 years in law enforcement, including 10 years as a flying warden with DNR — Willis was encouraged to apply for the job. “I probably won’t be flying any more than I was before because a big part of the chief pilot job is administrative,” said Willis, who did get a nice bump to the rank of captain. Aviation unit started with WWII vets Two of the aviation unit’s first pilots, Robert Hodge and John Parker, were recently inducted into the Minnesota Aviation Hall. Both men flew in the military during World War II and, in 1947, joined what then was the Minnesota Department of Conservation, Hodge in the Ely area and Parker at Warroad. The unit started with two planes and not much direction. One of two original Minnesota DNR aviation unit pilots, Robert Hodge was stationed in Ely starting in 1947. Contributed / Minnesota DNR “Before the era of GPS, we often didn’t know where these guys were or what they were doing,” Lofstuen noted. ADVERTISEMENT There currently are five pilots — including Willis — in the unit who are also licensed conservation officers and two others who are “natural resource” pilots who are not officers. Combined, they may fly over 2,000 hours for the DNR in a year. The Minnesota DNR's aviation unit has a mix of small aircraft used to conduct various natural-resource-focused missions across the entire state. Contributed / Minnesota DNR Lofstuen said it’s important that as many DNR pilots as possible are licensed officers who are trained in police work. “It’s essentially a flying police officer. And we see things other people might miss that might be important in the investigation,” Lofstuen noted. The DNR aircraft — planes and helicopters — and their pilots are stationed in Bemidji, Brainerd, Grand Rapids and Mankato but end up flying over all areas of the state. Those aircraft can take off and land not just from any airport in the state, but some are fitted with floats for summer lake work and then skis for winter. Willis has spent much of his time in a two-seat American Champion Scout, a tiny plane that is perfect for low-level reconnaissance. Another workhorse of the DNR fleet is the Cessna 185, including one stationed in Grand Rapids that has floats and wheels. Minnesota game wardens use both planes and helicopters to patrol the skies. Contributed / Minnesota DNR The aviation unit covers the entire state, especially for fish and wildlife missions like elk surveys in the far northwestern corner of the state and moose surveys in the far northeast. But the focus often is on state-managed lands, including 75 state parks, 1,300 miles of trails, 3,000 public access lakes and rivers and some 5 million acres of state forest. \"We try to prioritize what is pretty expensive flight time,\" Lofstuen said. \"Are we going to land that float plane on a lake to check one angler for a fishing license? That's probably not the best use of taxpayers' money when someone can do it from a boat. So we focus on the higher value things we can do.\" The DNR pilots spend most of their time flying low and slow, which requires constant attention to flying as well as whatever they are monitoring on the ground. A special waiver from the Federal Aviation Administration allows them to fly as low as 100 feet. They don’t often fly much at night or in bad weather, but all of the DNR pilots must be instrument-rated to fly in all kinds of Minnesota conditions. ADVERTISEMENT A historic photo of a Minnesota DNR aviation unit float plane on the job. Contributed / Minnesota DNR It has sometimes been dangerous work. In June 1999, Grant Coyour of Bemidji — a veteran DNR conservation officer and pilot — and a student biologist were killed when their 1977 Piper Cub airplane crashed into a bog during a moose survey in the Red Lake Wildlife Management Area south of Baudette. Next year, the aviation unit will take delivery of a new Cessna 206, a turbocharged single-engine aircraft that will be fitted with the latest in infrared and night vision sensing and photography technology aimed at helping in wildlife surveys. In other states, the same technology has been used to survey wildlife as small as grouse and as large as elk, Lofstuen noted. The technology can also be used to map wildfires at night, showing the size and footprint of the fire and locating where any hotspots may be. There’s even a laser option that can be used to direct wardens on the ground to a specific location. “In some sense, we’re using the same technology we were back in 1947… a pair of binoculars and a pilot looking out the window,” Lofstuen said, noting that conducting elk surveys, for example, requires the pilot to fly not much higher than tree-top altitude. The new technology will be safer and more accurate, he noted. “This is going to bring us into the modern era and really expand what we can do from the air.” more by john myers Subscribers Only Minnesota Video captures firefighters' harrowing dog rescue in Duluth Ship Canal Duluth firefighters climbed into 8-foot waves rolling in off Lake Superior to rescue a dog that had escaped its owner and leash 3d ago · By John Myers Subscribers Only Northland Outdoors Rural Duluth man may be the best wildlife artist you've never heard of Dec 8 · By John Myers Northland Outdoors Angry deer hunters rally against wolves, DNR, Democrats Dec 7 · By John Myers Subscribers Only Northland Outdoors More chronic wasting disease found in Minnesota deer Nov 30 · By John Myers Comments Share Share this article News reporting News reporting Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.

        "content": "Nick Kyrgios is famous for his controversial opinions. Recently, Kyrgios has been involved in a social media spat with tennis legend Boris Becker. During his X feud with Becker, Nick Kyrgios even got into an altercation with a tennis fan. Advertisement The Australian was responding to Becker and took a shot at the former World No.1 by suggesting he has an ego issue. Kyrgios claimed that he will not compare himself with the new generation of players after next 20-30 years. This tweet was met with different sort of responses but one reply stood out. Advertisement Nick Kyrgios and Boris Becker’s row on X is showing no signs of stopping. Both the tennis superstars are going back and forth at each other with their different opinions. Both the tennis stars have big personalities, which could only escalate the feud more. How did the Nick Kyrgios and Boris Becker feud begin? In an interview, Nick Kyrgios claimed that the older generation of players cannot compete with the new generation. The Australian believed that the like of Novak Djokovic would have easily beaten players like Pete Sampras and Boris Becker at their peaks. However, these comments did not go well with Boris Becker. Boris Becker claimed Nick Kyrgios make a lot of noise. Becker, who is co-incidentally also the former coach of Novak Djokovic, was unhappy with Kyrgios comparing the older generation of players like Rod Laver, Bjorn Borg, and John McEnroe, among others to the current generation. Becker even took a shot at Kyrgios for controversially having an OnlyFans account. It will be interesting to see how long this feud between these two big tennis personalities last for.",

        "content": "Mats Zuccarello and Matt Boldy scored in the shootout to lift the Minnesota Wild over the Calgary Flames 3-2 on Thursday night. Boldy and Marco Rossi scored in regulation for Minnesota, which is now 6-2 since John Hynes took over as coach for Dean Evason. Filip Gustavsson stopped 36 shots in goal for the Wild. \"It's just good to win,\" Boldy said. \"You've got a group of guys that work hard every night. Lotta desperation to win to get that kind of streak going and stuff like that, so a lot of credit to other guys.\" Yegor Sharangovich and Blake Coleman scored, while Dan Vladar made 30 saves for the Flames, who are 1-5-1 in their last seven games. MORE: St. Croix Lutheran Academy's Laura Hauge breaks state 3-pointer record Sharangovich also scored in the shootout, but Gustavsson stopped Nazem Kadri as the fourth shooter to preserve the win. \"This was a good game, probably for both sides, I would say,\" Calgary coach Ryan Huska said. \"I thought we had a slow first 10 minutes but then I liked our game from that point forward. I felt like we deserved the extra point tonight.\" Boldy has seven goals and two assists in the eight games since Hynes took control. He scored his eighth goal of the season in the first period. Sharangovich is on his own scoring streak, scoring for the fourth straight game. He scored on the power play in the second, giving him five goals in the past four games. Calgary took a lead in the third when Coleman's pass to Sharangovich went off defenseman Brock Faber's skate and into the goal. Coleman was credited with his ninth goal of the season and it was the sixth short-handed goal of the season for the Flames, which is tied for the third-most in the NHL. But Minnesota answered just 45 seconds later when Rossi one-timed a long rebound from Vladar to score for the second game in a row. Rossi has 10 goals, which is second behind Connor Bedard among NHL rookies. \"I didn't really hit it good,\" Rossi said. \"I fanned on it, but I'll take that.\" Both teams were missing important pieces of their defensive core. MORE: Red Bull Heavy Metal to bring street snowboarding event to St. Paul in February Minnesota placed Jonas Brodin on long-term injured reserve a day earlier with an upper-body injury and captain Jared Spurgeon was held out with a lower-body injury. Brodin was seen in pictures on social media with a cast on his right wrist/arm at a team function. Spurgeon is considered day-to-day. \"Thought it was a really strong team game for us,\" Hynes said. \"Injuries are part of the league. When you can play a really compact, strong team game, it gives you the best chance to win. Our D-core played really well, we played well as a five-man unit. I think when you can play with structure, everybody contributes, it gives you a chance to win.\" Chris Tanev, an assistant captain for Calgary, missed his second straight game with an upper-body injury and is considered day-to-day.

        "content": "Fanatics Sportsbook NJ is officially headed to the Garden State. Following the brand’s acquisition of PointsBet Sportsbook ‘s U.S. assets in June of 2023, PointsBet New Jersey is set to transition to Fanatics Sportsbook New Jersey in the early stages of 2024. Once the brand makes its debut in the state, a special welcome offer will be available to new users who register for an account using the Fanatics Sportsbook New Jersey promo code . Read on for more details regarding Fanatics Sportsbook New Jersey. We discuss its potential welcome bonus for new users, the features that help it compete in the legal sports betting industry , and other details about one of the fastest-rising sportsbooks on the market. Fanatics Sportsbook NJ is not currently available, but we expect a launch to happen in early 2024. Earlier this fall, CEO Michael Rubin said that the operator would go live in the biggest sports betting states during football season. Some of the other states expected to acquire the brand’s services include New York , Pennsylvania , Connecticut , and Michigan . As far as a launch date goes, we anticipate Fanatics Sportsbook NJ’s arrival sometime in early 2024. There have been some rumblings about states surrounding NJ launching the platform during the NFL season, which is now down to just December 2023 and January 2024. So, while there is nothing official, the clues tell us it could be sooner rather than later. The fact that Fanatics Sportsbook NJ is transitioning from PointsBet NJ should help expedite the process. Since Fanatics Sportsbook NJ is not yet live, there is no active promo code or welcome offer associated with it. We expect the welcome offer to be similar to the one currently live in the brand’s other active states. That offer allows users to Bet $10+ Over 5 Days, and Get $200 in Bonus Bets. If the operator implements the welcome offer in New Jersey the same way it does in other states, users won’t need a promo code at all.

We also discuss how to deposit funds and start playing so you can make the most of your welcome bonus. Most likely, you won’t need a promo code to claim the welcome offer at Fanatics Sportsbook NJ. This prediction stems from the fact that the operator provides its welcome offer to users in other states upon signup.

Once your Fanatics Sportsbook NJ account is verified and approved, you’ll need to deposit funds to start betting and claim your bonus.

Keep in mind that some deposit methods may have associated fees or processing times, so check the terms for each option. After completing the deposit, your account balance will reflect the deposited amount, and you can begin placing bets. You’ll have to deposit at least $10 to take advantage of the projected Bet $10+ for 5 Days, Get $200 in Bonus Bets welcome offer. Betting $10 per day translates to $40 in bonus bets per day. If you bet $10 each day over five days, you’ll need to deposit $50 and you’ll end up with a total of $200 in bonus bets. Fanatics Sportsbook NJ may require you to place wagers to get bonus bets. You can qualify for the operator’s welcome offer by participating in a range of ways to play that cater to both casual bettors and seasoned enthusiasts: Traditional pre-game betting is the most prevalent and straightforward form of sports betting. It revolves around predicting the outcome of a sporting event before it commences. Users engage in this process by scrutinizing the sportsbook’s odds, assessing potential outcomes such as victory, defeat, or a draw, and placing their bets accordingly. Examples of traditional pre-game bets encompass predicting the winner of a basketball game, estimating the total number of goals in a soccer match, or wagering on the point spread in a football game. Bettors who strategically place such wagers well in advance of the event may factor in considerations such as team statistics and player performance into their decision-making process. Live in-play betting is a dynamic facet of the sports betting world. It unfolds while a sporting event is in progress, enabling users to place bets on various outcomes and events during the game. The process involves users getting access to continuously updated odds based on the current situation as the game evolves. Users can engage in real-time betting on dynamic markets, such as predicting the next team to score, the outcome of the next play, or the total points in a quarter. Examples of live in-play bets include wagering on which team will score the next goal in a soccer match, predicting the outcome of the next drive in a football game, or betting on the winner of the next set in a tennis match. A parlay , also known as an accumulator or a combo bet, involves consolidating multiple individual bets into a single wager. All included bets must be successful for a parlay to win. In the parlay process, users select two or more separate bets and combine them into a single bet slip, with the odds for each selection being multiplied to determine the potential payout. While parlays present the allure of higher potential payouts due to the increased risk of multiple correct bets, they also entail a greater risk of losing, as every component must win for the overall bet to succeed. Prop bets, or proposition bets, introduce a unique dimension to sports betting by allowing users to bet on specific events or outcomes within a game that may not directly impact the final result. The process involves sportsbooks offering a diverse range of prop bets, spanning from predicting player performances (e.g., total yards a quarterback will throw) to specific occurrences (e.g., which team scores first). Examples of prop bets include wagering on the number of three-pointers a basketball player will make, predicting the player to score the first touchdown in a football game, or betting on the duration of the national anthem at a sporting event. These bets contribute diversity and entertainment to sports betting, enabling users to engage with specific elements of a game beyond merely predicting the final score. Here’s what to expect from the Fanatics Sportsbook NJ mobile app . As with any online sports betting platform , user experience can vary, so it can be helpful to understand the app’s strengths and weaknesses.

Chris Tomasson of the reports that the Saints wanted to sign DiNucci to their active roster, but he passed on the chance in order to stay on Denver’s practice squad because the Saints were only looking for someone until Jake Haener returned from a suspension. DiNucci confirmed the interest without naming the team this week and explained why he wanted to stay put. “There was a point in the season where another team had ,’’ DiNucci said. “I didn’t necessarily want to go. I didn’t necessarily want to be jumping around during the middle of the season. For quarterbacks, it’s tough. This is my first year [with the Broncos]. I want to be in the system and learn. I had a lot invested in this place.” Signing with the Saints would have guaranteed DiNucci three game checks on the active roster and he said the Broncos “told me they’d make it up to me by the end of the year.” The December 3 elevation brought him one game check and DiNucci expects to be elevated two more times in the final four weeks of the season.",

However, this victory doesn’t unfold on the racecourse but extends into a different realm. , Hamilton has transitioned into the world of skillfully producing high-quality non-alcoholic spirits and those efforts have now received accolades. Advertisement In a recent declaration, Lewis Hamilton has secured the esteemed Benvet Spirit Awards for his outstanding non-alcoholic spirit. This recognition underscores Hamilton’s groundbreaking entry into the non-alcoholic sector, partnering with the inventive Mexican spirits company, Casa Lumbre. Interestingly this brand is spearheading the category with an alternative spirit that retains the traditional ingredients and processes of tequila which is a rarity in the market. However, the centerpiece of this innovative movement is Almave, an exceptional creation crafted in partnership with the F1 champion Lewis Hamilton. Advertisement Notably, Almave distinguishes itself by incorporating cooked and distilled agave, paying homage to the authentic origins of tequila. Nevertheless, what sets it apart is its departure from the usual fermentation process, allowing this tequila counterpart to preserve the genuine essence of agave without the accompanying intoxicating effects. Certainly, upon receiving the award, fans must have recalled Hamilton’s initial description of the non-alcoholic beverage. In an interview with Robb Report, the seven-time champion passionately expressed how this innovative drink would introduce a unique and refreshing taste for individuals. What prompted Lewis Hamilton to venture into the non-alcoholic spirits industry? Lewis Hamilton consistently displays a visionary approach, gaining renown not only in racing but also in diverse businesses, including the NFL and soccer. However, his latest venture takes a unique turn into crafting non-alcoholic beverages. Considering his varied ventures, one may wonder what prompted the British ace to step into the non-alcoholic industry. Advertisement The primary answer lies in the industry’s burgeoning growth. According to Nielsen, non-alcoholic drink sales in the United States surged to $395 million between August 2021 and August 2022, marking a substantial 20% increase over the year. Another substantial reason behind introducing the drink is the increasing preference for sober lifestyles and conscientious drinking, exemplified by Hamilton himself. In recent years, as the 38-year-old has aged and maintained a commitment to excellence, he has placed a greater emphasis on his well-being. To achieve this, he embraced a plant-based diet, inspired by the numerous health and environmental benefits it offers. Nevertheless, despite the shift towards healthier choices, Hamilton maintained a consistent habit as an enthusiastic drinker, a practice he initiated at the age of 16. According to Hamilton, this aspect of his lifestyle appears inconsistent with the rest of his highly focused persona. Considering this, the British athlete mentioned in a interview, However, as he concluded, the seven-time champion clarified that his decision to prioritize well-being was more important to him than consuming alcohol. He said, Advertisement",

        "description": "The final trilogue meeting is scheduled for December 15. Here we explore who's pushing for more surveillance on journalists and what's at stake.",
        "content": "France, Italy and Greece are some of the seven countries pushing for enabling authorities to spy on journalists in case of national security, a new investigation has revealed. First published in September last year, the EU Media Freedom Act aims to bolster the independence and pluralism of the media sector in Europe. Yet, some commentators fear that without the right wording and provisions the new law will de-facto achieve the opposite results. Today, December 15, the EU Commission is holding what expected to be the final round of talks (trilogue) which it may seen the hardliner governments find a compromise with other members. As mentioned, the EU Media Freedom Act comes as an attempt to set some rules to ensure and protect media freedom and pluralism across the Union. It comes following concerns about a highly politicized media landscape. For this, it includes safeguards against political interference in editorial decisions and the use of spyware against journalists , a framework for transparency, increased protection of journalistic sources, and more. Despite its intentions being good and well-needed, the ongoing negotiations seems to have been shaping the law with some controversial clauses which are worrying commentators. \"The EU Media Freedom Act (EMFA), though well-intended, has significant flaws,\" wrote digital rights advocates at Electronic Frontier Foundation on December 6, commenting on a proposed special status for big media outlets whose content cannot be removed from big tech platforms. Another even more contentious point is then around the use of surveillance tools against journalists. Born as a way to make the practice illegal following high profile cases across Europe, some countries keep pushing for a \"national security\" clause (Article 4). According to Reporters without Borders , this is \"dangerous provision, which would poison the law from within.\" While the infamous Article 4 and the \"national security\" exemption is nothing new—it was added to the text in June, in fact—new revelations shed some light on those countries lobbying together to legitimize this type of state surveillance. A joint-investigation among three EU media outlets (Investigate Europe, French non-profit Disclose and Holland-based Follow the Money) revealed that France , Greece , Italy , Cyprus , Finland , Sweden and Malta are the seven governments still pushing to allow spyware use against journalists despite the wave of criticism across the industry. According to a document obtained by the media consortium which was written by a high-ranking German official present at the last trilogue on November 22, Italy expressed the strongest stances deeming the additional paragraph a \"must and red line.\" France, Finland and Cyprus said to be \"not very flexible\" on the issue. While, Sweden, Malta and Greece agreed \"with some nuances.\" \"Governments have no business being on journalists’ phones. We in the European Parliament have made provisions for this. It is unacceptable that member states are now trying to reintroduce this snooping paragraph through the back door,\" said one of the negotiators, German Green MEP Daniel Freund, to Investigate Europe. 🇪🇺#EU: IPI is concerned by revelations that #France, #Italy #Greece & other governments are pushing for loopholes for 'national security' regarding the surveillance of journalists amidst the final stages of EU negotiations on the #EuropeanMediaFreedomAct.https://t.co/55LpBzPJBR December 12, 2023 The biggest fear here is that such a provision will de-facto legitimize the unlawful use of Pegasus and Predator spyware against journalists, which has already occurred in Greece, Spain, Bulgaria and Hungary. These governments have all previously played the national security card to justify their actions. Before the latest revelations, 17 European media organizations signed an open letter calling for \"adopting robust wording in the final version.\" They wrote: \"We are deeply concerned about the chilling effect that could ensue if the final text sets conditions for disclosure of sources that fall short of international human rights standards and maintains the paragraph ‘This article is without prejudice to the Member States’ responsibility for safeguarding national security’. \"The EU has always been a stronghold of media freedom and pluralism, but today these central values are in decline. Where the rule of law is undermined, media freedom is often the first casualty.\" At the time of writing, representatives of EU member states are discussing these two very distinct lines on this thorny issue. We don't know which of the two will prevail eventually, but most likely the hardliners will need to find a compromise with the other states. Whether that will be enough to truly protect media freedom and journalists' privacy in Europe is yet to be seen.",

        "description": "The vice president Creative Assembly, Roger Collum, has apologized to Total War fans for the series' \"missteps.\"",
        "content": "The vice president of Total War studio Creative Assembly, Roger Collum, has released a lengthy statement apologizing to the strategy series’ fans for its “mistakes when it comes to our relationship with you all.” He outlined the studio’s plans to improve the poorly received Warhammer 3 DLC, Shadows of Change , delay the upcoming Thrones of Decay DLC, and alter the pricing of Total War: Pharaoh . In the statement , which was published yesterday (December 14), Collum said that “it has been a difficult few months,” and the studio has been engaged in “constant conversation internally on how we can get back to solid ground.” He noted: “We see the confusion, the frustration, and the distrust of us across the community and honestly, it breaks our hearts. We make games to bring you joy, to inspire a love of history, of fantasy, and strategy games. Total War is our everything, we care about it as deeply as you. Recently, it’s clear that we have failed to demonstrate that in our actions.” As Eurogamer reports , Total War: Warhammer 3’s Shadow’s of Change DLC was released in August, and currently sits on Steam with a ‘Mostly Negative’ user rating. Collum has now acknowledged that “we failed to meet your expectations of what a DLC should be,” and stated that Creative Assembly is working on a major free update which it hopes to release in February 2024 (although he noted that this window could change). The studio has committed to \"ensuring that we better meet your expectations going forward.\" Furthermore, as a result of this update, but also “to make sure that we don’t repeat our past mistakes, and to give you the amount of content that you rightly expect from us at these price points,” the Total War: Warhammer 3 Thrones of Decay DLC is being delayed to 2024, with the aim of launching it in April. It was originally supposed to launch before the end of 2023. Otherwise, Total War: Pharaoh , which was released in September, has been given a permanent price cut, taking it from $59.99 (£49.99) to $39.99 ($29.99). A FAQ section explaining the matter simply states that the team thought that this price was “fairer” - existing owners will receive partial refunds to make up the difference. Furthermore, the pricey Deluxe and Dynasty editions have been removed from sale, and Pharaoh ’s first paid DLC will now be a free update, set to release in early 2024. “We again apologize for the missteps we’ve made,” Collum concluded. “The mistakes of Total War are a shared responsibility by all the leaders of the franchise, and while it may not seem like it at times, we are listening.” Looking for some new game recommendations?

        "description": "Beeper Mini is having more problems, and Apple's getting blamed. But it's not like this is a huge surprise.",
        "content": "The saga of Beeper Mini continues as the iMessage workaround for Android devices has seemingly gone offline for the second time in the space of a week. Apparently this new wave of connectivity issues has affected around 5% of users, and Beeper Mini itself has been quick to pin the blame on Apple. The app claims that Apple is “deliberately blocking iMessage from being delivered.\" The Beeper X account has also been complaining about Apple’s efforts to block the services, stating that “it’s super annoying that Apple is penalizing their own customers and Android users who just want secure and encrypted chats.“ Adding, “we understand if you choose to uninstall Beeper Mini at this time.\" We realize how incredibly inconvenient this is for you. It's super annoying that Apple is penalizing their own customers and Android users who just want secure and encrypted chats. We understand if you choose to uninstall Beeper Mini at this time. Hope to have you back soon. December 14, 2023 But let’s be honest here; this doesn’t come as a huge surprise. Apple has already blocked the first loophole Beeper Mini utilized to access iMessage, and it was only a matter of time before the current workaround got targeted as well. It’s just surprising that this issue is only affecting a handful of users, rather than Beeper Mini as a whole. Not to mention the fact that this service is primarily aimed at Android users, and Apple has a long history of trying to pretend they don’t exist. So the comments about penalizing Apple’s own customers don’t make a lot of sense. It’s true that Apple has effectively crippled inter-platform communication up to this point by defaulting back to SMS and MMS when communicating with non-Apple devices. Both those systems are ancient from a tech standpoint, and have problems and restrictions that make the user experience less than ideal. Like character limits, file size limits and the lack of any kind of encryption. But this criticism has been leveled at Apple for years, and might finally be solved with the adoption of RCS in 2024 . The current system is still in use, and rather a bad look for Apple, but at least we know it’s on the way out. Apple has also claimed that apps trying to reverse engineer their way into iMessage pose a threat to user security and privacy. Beeper Mini denies this, claiming that it actually increases security , but after the allegations leveled against Songbird and Nothing Chats , it’s clear we shouldn’t take these sorts of claims at face value. Beeper Mini claims that it will continue working to get its Android app working with iMessage again, with particular emphasis on restoring phone number support — something Apple managed to block late last week. In the meantime, if you’re that concerned about the state of inter-platform communications, you can always try and convince your iPhone-toting friend to sign up for one of the best encrypted messaging apps . You know, the ones that have been around for quite some time and are typically free of controversy.",

Transcribe again lets you get a transcript in languages that aren’t currently supported by Pixel Recorder’s Live Transcription capability. After launching from the overflow menu of a previous session, select one of the available languages : It works by uploading that audio recording to Google’s servers. The company tells us that standard Google text-to-speech is being used here. This process takes a good minute or two and you’ll see a “Processing” card noting the status of the transcription. In our testing, you can’t use Transcribe again on something that already has a transcript in hopes of improving the quality. Version 4.2.20231031 of Recorder has widely rolled out.

        "description": "Partly thanks to remote work and education, most printers on sale became compatible with the now-ubiquitous Chromebook.",
        "content": "Once you’ve picked out one of the , you need some accessories to go with it. While a Chromebook comes with all the essentials, you’re likely to need a printer for it at some point. While many reports and documents are fine to be emailed, every once in a while, you’ll need to print something out. Printing may not be an everyday occurrence any more for many of us but who wants to have to go to a store to get it arranged at the last minute? Being able to print from home is so much more convenient. Finding a Chromebook-compatible printer isn’t as tricky as it sounds with the only distinction being that ChromeOS can’t print over Bluetooth. Everything else is free game though with Wi-Fi, USB, or wired LAN working just fine, and most printers working with a Chromebook right out of the box. With many printers for Chromebooks around, we’ve tracked down all the best printers for Chromebooks, based on expert opinion. We’ve considered that some of you may need a budget option while others want something much more high-end. As with any tech purchase, it’s important to consider your budget and needs when picking out a printer for Chromebook. There’s no one size fits all solution although there are definitely a handful that should appeal to the majority of people. Have a think about what you plan to use the printer for. Are you looking to solely print black and white documents or do you want to print photos too? Do you need it to be fast or is that not a priority? Do you need scanning functionality? Think about all these things before you dive into considering which printer to buy. Not everyone needs the as these are only appealing if you plan on also scanning documents as well as printing them. For some people, one of the will be just fine as they’re relatively inexpensive, low-maintenance and work just fine for printing out documents. Generally, you can pick one of the and you’ll be happy but there’s no point buying one packed with features that you don’t need. Printers range from being incredibly cheap at sub-$50 prices to costing hundreds of dollars. Not everyone needs to spend the price of a Chromebook on a printer but you might. If you’re planning on printing hundreds of pages every month, you don’t want to scrimp on a printer that will slow you down. That’s where it’s important to think about the features you want along with how much you can afford to spend. We’ve picked out printers that will work with ChromeOS and Chromebooks with the vast majority of printers doing so these days. However, you may have a specific connection in mind. If you want to hook it up directly to your network, check the printer has a wired LAN port. Alternatively, check for a Wi-Fi connection if you’re fine to go wireless or look for USB if that’s your need. When picking out the best Chromebook printers, we considered a handful of key factors. We looked at price while still appreciating that some people are willing to pay a lot for something high-end. We also considered reliability given no one wants a temperamental printer at a key time. We also looked at useful features such as how fast it can print, what it’s capable of printing of, and if it has any additional features that make it stand out from the crowd. We’ve used a lot of printers over the years spanning many different brands and features, such as regular inkjet printers right up to all-in-one solutions so we know what to look for in a printer that people genuinely want to use on a daily basis. If you work from home or even if you’re part of a small office setup, the Brother MFC-L3720CDW is highly capable of keeping up with your busy working life. It can print at up to 19 pages per minute as well as scan incredibly quickly too. To speed things up further, it has a 50-page auto document feeder so you can easily set up multi-page copy, scan, and fax jobs. A 250-sheet capacity paper tray makes it perfect for setting aside rather than needing by your side too. While it could be complicated, the Brother MFC-L3720CDW is actually very simple to use. That’s thanks to its 3.5-inch color touchscreen which has access to 48 custom shortcuts to simplify the process. You can easily connect the printer to popular cloud-based apps like Google Drive, Dropbox, Evernote, and OneNote, so it lends itself well to your cloud living life with a Chromebook. Plenty of connections are available with built-in dual band wireless along with Wi-Fi Direct, or you can always hook up the Brother MFC-L3720CDW directly via a USB 2.0 port. Brother is one of the best printer brands around and very highly respected for its reliability, especially when it comes to laser printing. It’s versatile stuff although potentially overkill if you just want to occasionally print a document. The beauty of laser printers is that they’re so much more reliable than an inkjet printer. They tend to cost more too as the HP Color LaserJet Pro 4201dw demonstrates but they’re a fantastic investment if you want something that won’t let you down for a long time. This model is designed with a small team in mind but what’s your household at heart, right? It’s incredibly fast being capable of printing up to 35 color pages per minute. Image quality is exceptional too as you’d expect with sharp detail and gorgeous colors too. If you’re printing hundreds of pages per month, this sped makes a huge difference. There’s also auto two-sided printing so all you need to do is fill the 50-sheet multipurpose tray and 250-sheet paper tray and you’re good to go. Via the wireless printing functionality, you can easily print from your Chromebook along with pretty much all other devices you can think of. The Epson Workforce WF-7840 has the right name being highly capable for work purposes. It’s an all-in-one solution so it can print pretty fast with up to 25 black pages or up to 12 color pages per minute. Results look great too thanks to accurate dot placement and instant-dry pigment inks that ensure professional-quality prints. It’s simple to use too with a 4.3-inch color touchscreen making it easy to find what you want to do. The Epson Smart Panel app works from your phone too if you want further control but simple wireless setup means you’re good to go whatever your plans. The Epson Workforce WF-7840 is also a scanner so you can easily copy documents while a large 500-sheet paper capacity spread across two 250-sheet trays and a 50-sheet rear tray all prove super convenient. If you only plan on printing the occasional document, the HP ENVY 6065e will suffice. It’s very simple to set up with a smart control panel ideal for direct printing or options via the HP Smart app. It also has useful features like self-healing Wi-Fi so it’s capable of automatically detecting and resolving connectivity issues to cut down on interruptions. While the HP ENVY 6065e isn’t exactly fast, it does have extras like automatic two-sided printing which makes things far more convenient for you. As standard, it prints at just seven pages per minute in color or 10 pages per minute in black and white, but that’s just fine for occasional usage where time isn’t essential. The HP ENVY 6065e is also a scanner capable of scanning up to 1200 x 1200 dpi as well as copying up to 300 x 300 dpi, so it’s good for a little bit of everything. A 100-sheet input tray and 25-sheet output tray means no need to keep too close to it while you work. The Canon PIXMA MG3620 isn’t the most exciting of printers to use but it’s a good option for those with limited space at home and not wishing to spend too much. It can print two-sided documents which is a useful time saver, although it can only print just 10 pages per minute in black and white or 5.7 pages per minute in color. Besides printing, the Canon PIXMA MG3620 is also a scanner so there’s no need to find room for an additional device in your limited home office storage space. The Canon PIXMA MG3620 works well wirelessly both thanks to Wi-Fi support and extensive app support, so it’s useful for more than just your Chromebook. If you want something straightforward if uneventful, the Canon PIXMA MG3620 will do the job well. Understandably, high print quality isn’t cheap. The Epson EcoTank ET-15000 is a big investment but it’s equally capable of some pretty large prints with the chance to print up to 13 x 19 inches. Print quality is truly stunning thanks to the use of a high density print chip which generates up to 40 million dots per second with some truly gorgeous accuracy. Versatile paper handling means you can print those extra large prints with the rear feed while there’s copy and scan support for up to 8.5 x 11 inches via the scan bed or 8.5 x 14 inches via the automatic document feeder. A 2.7-inch color touchscreen means you always know what’s going on while — of course — there’s wireless support. For a lot of people, the Epson EcoTank ET-15000 is going to be too much. Some people will have a Chromebook cheaper than this printer but if you plan on printing a lot of images and you want them at your best, you’ll love the Epson EcoTank ET-15000. Perfectly suited for extensive document printing, the Epson WorkForce Pro WF-3820 is a little slow with color prints but offers a speedy 25 pages per minute in black and white. Thanks to Epson’s PrecisionCore Heat-Free technology, you get a particularly fast first-page out along with reliable printing and reduced downtime too. There’s also high-precision printing with accurate dot placement and instant-dry pigment inks for professional-quality levels with your documents. To make things even simpler for you, there’s also auto two-sided printing along with one-sided 35-page automatic document feeder to help you go even faster with less effort. Everything about the Epson WorkForce Pro WF-3820 is simple to use so it’s an ideal addition to your home. Well regarded across the board, it’s not going to let you down. In a dorm room with your trusty Chromebook? Add on the HP DeskJet 2734e and you’ll be all set for printing out whatever needs printing. It’s certainly slow at just 7.5 pages per minute in mono or 5.5 pages in color, but it’s just fine for the occasional print out. That’s reflected by its fairly small yet functional 60-sheet input tray and 25-sheet output tray. The HP DeskJet 2734e is also a scanner and copier. Again, it’s not exactly speedy or packed with features but it’s just right for occasional tasks. There’s wireless and mobile printing support, while the HP DeskJet 2734e’s dual-band Wi-Fi has a self-reset feature if there’s a problem. Look out for the fact that the HP DeskJet 2734e won’t work with non-HP cartridges but other than that, it’s a good basic model for the most minimal of requirements.",

Christine Sounds and sights of Lake Ohrid, Albania Lake Ohrid, eastern Albania. Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images Our summer 2023 trip took us on a tour of Albania. We loved Tirana and its lively drivers, Berat bewitched us, historical Gjirokaster entranced us and we chilled out by the beach in Himarë. But it was tiny Lin in the Korçë region, eastern Albania, perhaps the oldest inhabited settlement in Europe, dating back to 6,000 BC, that totally captured our hearts. Our accommodation on the shores of Lake Ohrid offered amazing views across to North Macedonia. Delicious homecooked meals, including the tasty local Ohrid brown trout caught by the owner, were served on the terrace overlooking the lake where we were serenaded by a noisy frog chorus.

Young and inclusive, Wrocław There is plenty of scope for boat trips on the rivers and canals of Wrocław. Photograph: ewg3D/Getty Images Wrocław is an underrated city, a place to be immersed in river boat trips, £1.30 pints, chimney cakes and cobbled streets. The cathedrals are stunning, the people are warm and kind and it’s just about within day-trip range of the beautifully preserved German town of Görlitz. As a centre of academia in Poland, it has plenty of inclusive, youth-friendly bars and shops, and for far less money than in France, Belgium or Germany you can enjoy a truly authentic European long weekend. Aaron Every day in Georgia we ate bread filled with oozing cheese An adjaruli khachapuri (cheese-filled bread) Photograph: Radist/Getty Images Khachapuri , bread filled with oozing, melted cheese, was so irresistible, cheap and ubiquitous, I ate it every day for two weeks in Georgia with each regional variation evoking travel memories. Breakfast in Tbilisi was warm imeruli khachapuri , stuffed with sour, salty Imeretian cheese ; while a version full of cheese and nettles warmed the soul on a dreary night in the Kazbegi mountains. In the Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti region of western Georgia, we had megruli khachapuri , with sulguni cheese in the middle and on top, which was like pizza on speed. But we saved the best for the Black Sea resort Batumi: adjaruli , an iconic canoe-shaped bread, full of cheese swimming in butter. Lovely! Helen Jackson Sea, surf, rock arches and beer, Galicia, Spain Catedrais beach. Photograph: Luna Marina/Getty Images Head to As Catedrais beach (Cathedral beach) in Galicia, north-west Spain, for incredible rock formations and turquoise waters. It takes its name from the huge arches which resemble the flying buttresses of a cathedral. During high tide the formations are hidden, but as the tide subsides beautiful arches and caves are revealed. Exploring these and sploshing through the beautifully clear water is pure pleasure. When you’re done exploring there is a cafe on the cliff top serving cold beers with views of the sea and surf below. Laura Tipple in the taverna, Volos, Greece Dishes at a Volos taverna. Photograph: Wirestock, Inc./Alamy Volos is a city in eastern Greece that many pass through en route to the Sporades islands, but we stayed a bit longer and discovered the culture of tsipouradika . Order a small bottle of tsipouro (a wine-based spirit), and a meze or two will come with it. If there are two of you, you get double; four and they quadruple it – it’s a social thing. The first meze are basic: aubergine salad, cured fish. Then the more you drink, the better they get: grilled sea bream, scallops. There are no menus, but as it’s a fishing city, seafood dominates. With hundreds of tsipouradika tavernas throughout Volos, it’s an integral part of local life and one I’m glad to have discovered.

It’s right on the Thames Estuary path. There’s a second world war battery next door, and Coalhouse Fort is at the end of the road. For a real sense of the edge of things, walk up the path to Tilbury Fort just after high tide; it’s lonely, desolate and incredibly atmospheric. This is where Elizabeth I rallied her army nearby to face the threat of the Armada in 1588. It’s a half-mile walk to the jetty for the ferry to Gravesend here. At the other end of East Tilbury is the old Bata estate , a modernist masterpiece best explored by bike. Tim Smith Canny meandering, Essaouira, Morocco Fruit and veg on sale in Essaouira. Photograph: Grant Rooney/Alamy The Essaouira Sunday souq on Avenue Moulay Hicham is an un-Googleable paradise of organic produce. Our landlady showed us the way, cannily meandering, pausing to ask a price, split open a pea pod, exchange gossip. Essaouira, best known for surf and seafood, is also ridiculously fertile. November and December are best, when all the key Moroccan ingredients are at their peak. A truckload of corn in their husks? Thick bunches of wormwood? Artichokes, their stalks intact for soup making? One step back from the coast, the Essaouira land was brought to us, and it was delicious.

We were the only people there. The double waterfall is framed by the 899-metre peak of Great Gable, and looks out to the Wasdale valley below. After an invigorating dip we headed back to our timber cabin in Irton near Ravenglass and watched a thunderstorm from the half-moon window. Rachel Donnison Winning tip: Cycling and refuelling on the Hebridean Way Crust, Lewis In August we cycled the 184-mile Hebridean Way from Vatersay to the Butt of Lewis. Our best discovery? The food! We enjoyed fudgy brownies from Ardmhor Coffee while waiting at Barra ferry terminal. A day later we arrived, soaked to the skin, at the Hebridean Jewellery Cafe on South Uist and had the best brie and cauliflower soup ever. We ate, overlooking the beach, at the Wee Cottage Kitchen trailer on North Uist; my partner loved his scallop and black pudding roll. And on Lewis we hunkered down beside a blue shipping container, sheltering from the wind, with yummy Neapolitan pizza from Crust . Christine",

        "description": "Tucked between Walt Disney Studios and Griffith Park, the Burbank Rancho Equestrian District bridges the horse lifestyle and city living.",
        "content": "A spritely woman leading a white horse waves at me from a perfectly suburban street corner in Burbank looking like an ethereal ghost of rodeos past. Instantly, I know it’s Tarrah Barbour, who invited me to visit an equestrian neighborhood tucked in a far-from-rural nook between Walt Disney Studios and Griffith Park. I look up and down the quiet, leafy street just an exhale away from the thumping heartbeat of the San Fernando Valley and wonder where on earth even one horse could be kept. Barbour, 44, buzzing with energy despite rising in the early hours to tend to horses, introduces me to her horse Kota and then leads me around the corner. A parallel rustic world emerges: past a cherry red Chevy pickup truck and horse trailer is the entrance to stables. There I meet Hector Aguilar, who proudly recounts riding USC’s mascot , a horse named Traveler — and whips out a June 2014 copy of The Times featuring a photo of him atop the regal creature to prove it. Sheena Graves , a Hollywood horse wrangler, mills around in serious-looking leather boots. For many residents of the Burbank Rancho Equestrian District, as well as the adjacent Riverside Rancho in Glendale, life revolves around their equine charges. Even with hired help, taking care of the graceful but massive creatures requires investment — of time, money and heart. Karen Thornton, a Burbank Rancho resident with a small gaggle of farm animals, including a horse and a pony, told me that being a horse person leaves virtually no time for other hobbies. Taking vacations is tough. “It’s more of a lifestyle,” she said. For some, it’s a dream come true. “Every morning I wake up and I feel like I’m an 8-year-old girl,” Barbour told me, eyes shining behind oversize circular sunglasses. By the time Barbour starts work (as an advertising producer) at 9:30 a.m., she’s typically exercised three horses. Perhaps a gallop at Griffith Park or lunging — driving a horse around a circle on a rope — in a patch of land called the Pollywog . She checks on the animals at 6 p.m. and then again by 11 p.m. and relies on twice-daily visits by Jose Alberto Lomeli, 80, who, for a half-century, has cared for horses in the area. “Rain, shine, earthquake, every single day — now 24 years without a day off,” Lomeli said. Film studios and equestrians in the area have long enjoyed a symbiotic relationship. Just as the first movie production companies moved into Burbank in the 1920 s, large farms and ranches sprang up. By the 1940s, those expansive lots were subdivided into small homes, many with horse stalls in the back. That proximity became an asset when horses, and someone to handle them, were needed on set. (Horse celebrity Mr. Ed once lived there, USC’s mascot still does.) Most of my horseback riding experience dates back to toddlerhood when my parents took me to the now-closed Griffith Park Pony Rides . But alongside Barbour I feel at ease astride a gentle brown steed named Charlie. We depart from Studio Horse Rental — the only remaining horse rental facility in Burbank — and make our way across the Mariposa Bridge over the L.A. River that connects Burbank to more than 4,000 acres of land in Griffith Park. Ten of us, five riders and five horses, pass under the 134 Freeway and past the Martinez Arena , a first-come, first-served public equestrian area. Eventually, we veer away from concrete and plod along a dirt trail through the trees. I feel comfortable as we saunter along the path — even when the horses switch from a slow walk to a trot. As the pace momentarily quickens, a sense of freedom surges up. Atop the strong, graceful creature, I absorb some of its power. I become conscious of how tall I’ve grown. The allure of horse life clicks. How to get your horse on in the city Barbour says she sometimes rides to Basecamp , a local coffee shop, for a morning cup of joe. So consider that a good starting point. Those who want to experience what it’s like to meander on horseback can book a guided trail ride at one of the local rental facilities. Studio Horse Rental located near the horse bridge on Mariposa Street is open seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and welcomes riders of all skill levels. My one-hour ride through Griffith Park cost $50. Another option is L.A. Horse Rentals , a stone’s throw away in Glendale. Rides between 30 minutes and 1.5 hours are offered daily, with prices ranging from $30 to $75. Longer trail rides can be booked on weekends. If you’re interested in mastering the ropes (and reins as it were), consider taking a lesson. Studio Horse Rental offers them. When dismounting from my ride, I met trainer Lorie Martan, whom my Rancho companions praised for her gifted ways of working with children. L.A. Equestrian Center hosts trainers specializing in an array of training styles. Details are available at thelaec.com . Traditional Equitation School , located in the center, bills itself as the oldest horseback riding school in L.A. Prices start at $93.50 for a single lesson. Experienced riders are welcome to haul over their horse for a day in Griffith, a lunge in the Pollywog or a roll in Martinez Arena. Boarding is available at the Equestrian Center. Food and equipment can be purchased at Damoor’s or Trickee Tack, located on the same lot as L.A. Horse Rentals. And, if you need any leather repairs, hoof it over to A&M Leather Shop, run by Lomeli and his longtime business partner Miguel Angel Garcia and located behind Border Brothers Dry Cleaners & Laundry . 1. Walk — or run — past holiday lights. Ever since I was a teenager, I’ve loved to jog the streets of L.A. as a means to explore neighborhoods. The time between Halloween and Christmas is a particularly great time to do this because you get the seasonal benefit of taking in holiday lights and festive facades. The lights also literally brighten up an evening foray. Walking is perfectly acceptable, but a quicker clip allows you to cover more ground. Need some inspo? My colleague Jeanette Marantos compiled this list of 30 dazzling light displays across Southern California. 2. Experience a winter wonderland at a park near you. Through Dec. 16, dozens of L.A. County parks will be transformed into winterscapes complete with 40 to 80 tons of snow for sledding and playing. Free and open to all ages, the Parks After Dark: Winter Wonderland events will also feature family- and teen-friendly crafts, hot cocoa and snacks, carnival games, toy giveaways, holiday music and more. Hosted by L.A. County Parks and Recreation, the events will be held Fridays and Saturdays from either noon to 4 p.m. or 4 to 8 p.m A full list of parks and their event times is available at parks.lacounty.gov . 3. Get merry on a guided Griffith Park hike. On Dec. 16, naturalist Jason Wise will lead a group on a one-mile hike to celebrate the native fauna in our backyard with a crafty wintertime twist. Participants will forage mistletoe to transform into a decoration, learn about the native California holly and craft ornaments from pine cones. Warm cider, craft supplies and hiking lessons will be provided on the two-hour experience running from noon to 2 p.m. Hosting the hike is Usal Outdoor Research Center, a community hub and store geared toward the “modern nature enthusiast.” Tickets are $30. Details and booking at usalproject.com . Three men, two ropes and one sleeping bag. Those were the essential — and notably minimal — ingredients for a celebrated recent ascent of the north face of dizzyingly sheer Mount Jannu in the Himalayas. Some have summited the daunting peak, but none have done this particularly challenging route in the light alpine style employed by a trio of Americans who successfully reached the 25,295-foot summit on Oct. 12, John Branch explains in a recent piece for the New York Times . Alan Rousseau, Matt Cornell and Jackson Marvell tackled the summit — notorious for its height, steepness and remote locale — without supplemental oxygen, fixed ropes or the help of porters beyond base camp. Top alpinists have lauded the feat as one of the most significant in climbing, exceeding the difficulty of scaling Everest. Besides its impressive athleticism, the climb represents a hopeful alternative to navigating crowds that have improbably become common on Everest and other behemoths. Happy adventuring, Every month, local gallerist Lauren Powell leads a procession of art lovers up a steep trail to a pine tree grove overlooking the L.A. Basin. Besides trail snacks and water bottles, the crew hauls up art, thereby freeing it from the potentially exclusionary gallery space. “I would say this is a pilgrimage to bring the gallery outside of the four walls to the public,” Powell told my colleague Deborah Vankin, who chronicled the recurring ritual . On a recent trek, a group of roughly 30, decked out in primarily sunset-hued threads, carried hulking paintings by Senon Williams, giving off what Vankin described as “a Burning Man -meets- Sierra Club vibe.” Once they reached an area adjacent to the iconic Griffith Observatory, they installed the works for a temporary open-air exhibit. As the sun set, the paintings appeared to dissolve against the golden backdrop. The hikes are free and open to the public, with the next one scheduled for Dec. 17.

        "description": "These Americans abroad seem to be living the dream and thanks to their streams of content, TikTok users can follow along and live vicariously through them.",
        "content": "A month’s paid vacation time. Wine at lunchtime on a Tuesday. No tipping needed. In Kacie Rose Burns’ most , the influencer runs through some of the biggest culture shocks she’s experienced since upping sticks from the US to Italy. Burns’ TikTok – viewed 19.8 million times – is flooded with comments ranging from disbelief, envy and approval. There’s one comment – liked 34,800 times – that maybe sums it all up: “I think the American dream is to leave America.” Burns’ social media accounts chronicle her experiences as, according to her TikTok bio, “that American girl living in Italy.” She details cultural differences, offers guides to Italian cities and speaks directly to the camera about her experiences. The 30-year-old started posting on TikTok in 2021 when she moved to Florence with her Italian boyfriend, who she In early 2021, international travel was off the table. Burns’ videos quickly gained traction thanks to her mix of escapist content, wish fulfillment fantasy and funny-yet-insightful takes on the realities of moving abroad. Cut to today and Burns has 1 million TikTok followers. Fans approach her on the street and act like they know her. She’s leveraged her success into a brand, complete with ebooks and group tours. Chronicling her life in Italy is now her full time job. It’s a career move that Burns, a former New York dancer, says was entirely accidental. The success has taken her by surprise. But Burns isn’t alone. In recent years – as TikTok has ballooned in popularity and Instagram has embraced short-form video content in the shape of Instagram Reels – the American influencer abroad has become an omnipresent figure. No matter your algorithm, if you’re active on these platforms it’s likely you’ve seen a video or two along these lines. Maybe an influencer wandering around a UK grocery store, commenting on how bizarre it is that British stores don’t store eggs in the refrigerator, or someone chronicling their attempts to learn French while in situ in Paris, or showing the incredible views from their red-roofed Lisbon apartment. For American social media user Elizabeth Staub, 31, watching TikTokers who’ve moved abroad is appealing partly because their content feels “like an easy daydream” or “escape.” But it’s a fantasy that’s “also kind of attainable,” as Staub puts it to . These people might seem to have a day-to-day that’s straight out of a Netflix romantic comedy, but they’re real people. And for Staub, it’s this reality that makes it easy to insert herself in their shoes – at least for the few minutes it takes to watch one of their videos. “I really enjoy seeing the differences between our country and wherever these influencers are, and romanticizing what it would be like to live there,” says Staub. “I follow people who live in places I’d want to live,” agrees Boston-based social media user Erin Conry, 26. It feels like a dopamine hit, Conry tells CNN Travel, every time she sees “these aesthetically pleasing travel videos.” These Americans abroad seem to be living the dream and thanks to their streams of content, TikTok users can follow along and live vicariously through them. Many of the most popular videos from US content creators abroad hinge on the little details. Take Quentin Pettiford’s social media presence. Pettiford, 24, moved from the US to Norway in 2021. Like Burns, he emigrated after falling in love with a European, and like Burns, people love hearing about his transatlantic love story – but if his TikTok stats are anything to go by, they’d rather hear his thoughts on the differences between Norwegian and American grocery stores. Pettiford gets it. The first time he walked the aisles of a Norwegian grocery store, he was entranced. For his Norwegian partner, the experience was mundane – boring, even – but for Pettiford, the store was a treasure trove of intriguing cultural differences. He was baffled by the bread slicers, something he’d never seen in an American grocery store. He soon learned that when you leave certain stores in Norway, you have to scan your receipt in order to open the doors. “Everything about the grocery stores here in Norway is just so different,” Pettiford tells CNN Travel. Pettiford immediately started filming clips and posting on his . “I knew that if the right people saw it, they’d be interested and it would go viral,” he says. Sure enough, one day Pettiford opened the TikTok app to thousands of comments, views and follows. “It got two million views in a couple of weeks,” says Pettiford of his first viral video. “I was like, ‘You know what, I’m not going to let this opportunity slip.” Pettiford dove head on into content creation. Today, he intersperses funny commentary on cultural differences with glimpses into his day-to-day family life with his Norwegian wife and their young daughter. His followers seem to enjoy that family content, says Pettiford, but his most popular video isn’t particularly personal at all – it’s “me talking about how Americans use Fahrenheit, and how the rest of the world uses Celsius.” “That got, like, 8 million views,” says Pettiford, sounding disbelieving. “Little things like that, people go crazy for. So I just kind of sit back, reflect on what’s different, write it in my notes and then talk about it and see if it goes viral.” Burns and Pettiford both started posting during the pandemic – partly because they found themselves with more time on their hands and partly because that’s just when they happened to move abroad. But thirtysomething Fatima, an American content creator who runs the TikTok , had lived in Paris for several years before she started posting publicly about her life in early 2021. Like former dancer Burns, Fatima worked in the performing arts industry pre-2020 and found herself turning to social media as a “different way to be creative” when Covid hit. Fatima, who has requested her last name not be included in this article for personal reasons, was also inspired to start posting publicly in the wake of the Netflix hit “Emily in Paris.” The much talked about TV show tracks a fictional American social media influencer who moves to a version of Paris that bears little resemblance to the city’s reality, but which quickly enamored locked-down-viewers when the show landed on Netflix in late 2020. Fatima watched – and enjoyed – “Emily in Paris.” But seeing the show’s success also prompted her desire to show a more realistic view of the “American in Paris” tale. It’s a tale, Fatima acknowledges, that is, if not as old as time, certainly pretty old – she recalls watching the 2014 Broadway musical “An American in Paris,” based on the 1950s movie, the week before she moved to France. The pop culture trope of an American moving to Europe and living a charmed life also extends beyond Paris and predates the 21st century – think 1954’s Rome-set “Three Coins in the Fountain.” For millennial Fatima, it was the 2003 “Lizzie McGuire Movie” – in which American teen Lizzie takes a trip to Italy and is accidentally mistaken for a pop star – that first had her dreaming about moving to Europe. “That movie is very iconic for me, very important,” says Fatima. “When I finally went to Italy, and I was in front of the Trevi Fountain, I couldn’t stop talking about it. And I kid you not – like five minutes into like me being in that location, there was another American talking about the same movie.” Fatima points out that most of these movies and TV shows depict “White women of a certain socio-economic background moving to Europe to pursue their ‘Eat, Pray, Love lifestyle.’” Fatima realized her TikTok was an opportunity to broaden that overriding pop culture narrative. “To be a Black American in Paris, it really does inform how I go about my life in this country,” she says. In one of the pinned videos on Fatima’s TikTok, she’s shown walking around picturesque Parisian streets, speaking directly to the camera and promising followers “range, details, information, tips, tricks, silly stories of my times past, and TBH just my reality of living in Paris.” directly engages with the pop culture tropes of Americans living abroad. For one, there’s a direct reference to fictional “Emily” – Fatima calls herself “Fatima in Paris” both in the video and her TikTok bio. And the video is soundtracked to the “Sex and the City” theme music – nodding to the moment in that series when fictional heroine Carrie Bradshaw decided to start over in Paris. “My content does have an aspect of escapism, and that’s by design,” says Fatima. “I try to make content that is fun and engaging for me, and also fun and engaging for the audience that might want to consume it.” For Fatima, social media has also turned out to be an alternative revenue stream – although she doesn’t make a full time living off her content, she does make a profit. “To put things into perspective, I have made enough money (post taxes) to pay two months worth of rent including utilities in the calendar year of 2023,” she tells CNN Travel. Kacie Rose Burns also makes money from her social media content via occasional branded content, but she says social media only became a full time career once she began running group tours in Italy and started her business. Burns says she also avoids any branded content she doesn’t think will resonate with her followers. For both Burns and Fatima, keeping their content as “real” as possible is important to them. For example, while Fatima’s content always has an appealing touch of glamor, she stresses to CNN that “living in France, living in Paris, is not this idealistic perfect utopia that a lot of people set it out to be” “I’m fully aware of that and fully cognizant of that. And every now and then I do talk about that on my platforms. I talk about the realities of living in this country,” she says. Burns – who, like Fatima, is well aware of the pop culture tropes she’s playing with – also says she tries to strike that equilibrium in her content. “It’s healthy to romanticize your life so that you find beauty in it,” Burns says. “But I also think it’s important, at the same time, to talk about the hard parts too, because life in Italy is not like ‘Lizzie McGuire.’ It does have its pain points. It’s not like ‘Under the Tuscan Sun.’ It’s not like ‘Eat, Pray, Love.’ There are definite, hard challenges to overcome. And there are a lot of things such as homesickness, that will never fully go away.” While a lot of popular social media accounts chart the adventures of Americans in Europe, there are accounts depicting “fish out of water” adventures across the globe. Ananya Donapati’s TikToks, for example, chronicles her life as an American in Japan. For the 23-year-old Californian, moving to Japan was the culmination of a dream that started when she discovered manga comics and started learning Japanese in her early teens. When the pandemic hit, Donapati almost cast the dream aside, figuring it was never going to be possible. But then the founder of a Japanese fintech startup found Donapati’s popular Twitter account and reached out, offering her a marketing job. Donapati left the US for Tokyo earlier this year. Although she was big on Twitter, now called X, it didn’t occur to Donapati to create TikToks about her new life until she started seeing other Americans doing the same. Now Donapati posts regular dispatches, funny observations and guides to Tokyo on her account The goal, says Donapati, is “to share what Japan has to offer, through the beauty that I see through my eyes, through my content.” Donapati had no qualms about filming herself and her experiences, she’s Gen Z and grew up watching YouTubers. To her, the whole thing seemed “kind of natural.” “I’ve always wanted to create content,” says Donapati “And I feel like a lot of people my age tend to have that desire.” Donapati enjoys the creativity that comes with the platform’s limitations – videos have to be short and snappy to catch the attention of a scrolling, time poor social media user who wants to “see something new, wants to be entertained,” as Donapati puts it. “So the more that you’re yourself and creative, I think you really get a lot of eyes on you, and a lot of support as well.” Donapati still enjoys watching content created by other Americans in Japan. She finds comfort in seeing some of her experiences reflected back at her, and also finds these videos helpful as she continues to navigate life abroad. “It’s extremely important to rely on each other, get advice,” she says. “And I think the content creation that everyone’s doing is kind of an extension of that.” Donapati also enjoys watching American content creators who post about their life elsewhere in the world. For Donapati, the appeal is that it’s “very real.” “I really like seeing, let’s say, someone in Europe and their life living there,” she says. “I definitely watch videos like that, it’s great, because I feel like I’m there without having to be there.” It’s not only American content creators who post about their experiences abroad on social media. Donapati also follows Japanese content creators living in the US, while Fatima likes reliving her New York years via content created by Europeans who’ve relocated to the US. But the proliferation of Americans posting about their experiences abroad suggests it’s a particularly popular trend in the US. US social media user Elizabeth Staub suggests glimpses of life abroad grow ever more appealing to Americans “as our country becomes a mess with regards to healthcare, affordable living and lack of third spaces in our community.” Burns suggests it’s also because the difficulties associated with international travel in the US didn’t end when pandemic travel restrictions were lifted. “We don’t have federal paid time off, people can’t take time off work, flying is impossible, it costs thousands of dollars to take a flight to Europe – it’s really expensive,” she says. “It’s just not a reality for a lot of people.” There’s a stereotype, suggests Burns, that Americans aren’t interested in traveling abroad. But many people, especially younger Americans, “want so badly to travel, but maybe they don’t necessarily have the means to do it.” “So they travel through their phone,” she says. “It’s easy to find Americans traveling abroad [on TikTok] and then they’re able to experience it through somebody that has a similar background.” Her words are echoed by social media user Erin Conry. “They’re living my dream,” she says of the Americans abroad she follows. The content she loves is informative and insightful, but overall just a “great escape.” “It’s cool to see that people have the confidence to actually live out that kind of life.” The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "description": "For the first time ever, Disneyland has released details on each of the seasonal celebrations, special events and limited-time offerings planned for the year ahead.",
        "content": "Disneyland fans will need to go out and buy their 2024 calendar a little earlier than usual now that the full lineup of events and dates has been released for all of next year at the Anaheim theme parks. For the first time ever, Disneyland has released details on each of the seasonal celebrations, special events and limited-time offerings planned for the year ahead. The calendar will be filled on more than 300 days of the 366-day leap year in 2024 with a slate of festivities at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure. Disneyland decided to release the full calendar for 2024 during the first full week of December 2023 so fans can plan ahead and book reservations well in advance of the upcoming event. The advance planning strategy brings Disneyland more in line with Walt Disney World where visitors plan months in advance for vacations tied to specific events and times of the year. Disneyland hopes to encourage visitors to stretch overnight or weekend stays into longer vacations that extend into multiday or weeklong trips — just like travelers at the Florida theme park resort. The Disneyland calendar was recently extended to a 180-day window so visitors can plan further in advance and book theme park reservations and hotel stays. Here’s the lineup of events planned for Disneyland and Disney California Adventure in 2024. The annual food festival paying tribute to Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese traditions returns to DCA. The Year of the Dragon celebration means Mushu will lead Mulan’s Lunar New Year parade. Disneyland announced plans for four after-hours, separate admission special events in the first half of 2024 — without providing any details on themes or dates. The five Disneyland After Dark events in 2023 included the returning Sweethearts Nite (late January and early February), Throwback Nite (mid-April) and Star Wars Nite (early May) along with the new Princess Nite (early March) and Pride Nite (mid June). Previous years have seen Villains Nite, Pixar Nite, Grad Nite Reunion, 80s Nite and 90s Nite. Star Wars Nite and Sweethearts Nite are likely locked in for 2024 with the other two slots remaining open for new or returning special events. Chances are good for a Pixar Nite tied to Pixar Fest starting in late April. The annual tribute to gospel music returns to the Fantasyland Theatre with a pair of headliner musicians and a host of Southern California community choirs. The Feb. 17 show will be headlined by Marvin Sapp and the Feb. 24 show will feature Tasha Cobbs. The Anaheim NHL team celebrates its 30th anniversary in DCA’s Hollywood Land. Current and former Ducks players will take part in a fan zone with plenty of photo opportunities and a cavalcade parade. The 2024 version of the venerable Food & Wine Festival returns to DCA with California-centric food, beer and wine, celebrity chefs and Disney characters dressed in their best foodie attire. Fans of the classic Soarin’ Over California will get another chance to hang glide over Napa Valley, Monterey Bay and Redwood Creek when the classic version of the flight simulator ride returns during the food fest. The annual Star Wars celebration returns to Tommorowland and Galaxy’s Edge for a two-month run on either side of May 4 — the unofficial holiday of the epic saga. New planetary excursions will be added to Star Tours starting on April 5. Also starting on April 5, a galactic soundtrack featuring Star Wars symphonic music will be played in Galaxy’s Edge during Disneyland fireworks shows. Hyperspace Mountain will be back in Tomorrowland along with specialty Star Wars-themed food, drinks and merchandise. The Pixar-centric festival that helped launch Pixar Pier in 2018 is back again at both parks. The new Better Together parade will debut at DCA while the “Together Forever” fireworks and projection show returns to Disneyland with a few new scenes. The red panda version of Mei Lee and the 4*Town boy band from “Turning Red” along with Ember and Wade from “Elemental” will be among the characters taking part in Pixar Fest. The reimagined Paradise Pier Hotel will officially become Pixar Place Hotel on Jan. 30 — giving fans a chance to add an extra dose of Pixar to the 10-week festival. The nighttime spectacular returns to the Rivers of America with a new climactic battle scene between Sorcerer Mickey and Maleficent. A fire that destroyed the towering audio-animatronic Maleficent dragon forced a yearlong renovation of the show. Seasonal decor will once again fill both parks with a massive Mickey Mouse jack-o-lantern on Main Street U.S.A., Headless Horseman statue on Buena Vista Street and Radiator Screams makeover of Cars Land. Expect to see the return of holiday attraction overlays for the Haunted Mansion in Disneyland and Guardians of the Galaxy — Mission: Breakout, Mater’s Junkyard Jamboree and Luigi’s Rollickin’ Roadsters in Disney California Adventure. DCA’s Plaza de la Familia event in Paradise Gardens celebrating the Mexican traditions of Dia de los Muertos with music from “Coco” runs a few extra days through Nov. 2. Disneyland attached dates to virtually every event in 2024 except one: Oogie Boogie Bash. The wildly-popular Halloween event sold out in 12 hours in 2023. Announcing the Oogie Boogie Bash dates too soon might lead to squatters booking Disney hotel rooms that would need to be canceled later if fans can’t manage to get tickets for the event. The Christmas season has become one of the busiest times of the year at Disneyland. While it’s too soon to book theme park tickets for Christmas 2024, it’s not too early to begin thinking about what you’re going to do next holiday season — before this one has really gotten started. The Disney Festival of Holidays will once again return to Disney California Adventure Park in 2024. The former Splash Mountain log flume ride is undergoing a transformation into a new attraction themed to Disney’s 2009 animated film “ThePrincess and the Frog.”",

There are extra trains on weekdays between Nottingham and Birmingham and some thinning out (yet again) of TransPennine Express schedules. A new high-speed line through Spain’s Cantabria mountains opened last month. Photograph: Gonzalo Azumendi/Getty Images However, across the Channel, the unstoppable rail renaissance continues apace, with many new services in the 2024 schedules. In much of Europe those 2024 timetables were introduced on 10 December. There are exceptions. A new high-speed line through Spain’s Cantabrian mountains opened in late November, and new timetables for some routes in Poland and the Baltic states won’t come into effect for another week or two. Winners and losers For the most part, the 2024 timetables are good news for rail travellers. Of course, there are winners and losers. Copenhagen secures more direct services to Hamburg, while Aarhusloses out as its direct trains to Hamburg are axed. Few will shed too many tears in Aarhus as the compensation for losing those twice-daily direct trains is a new connecting service every two hours from Denmark’s second-largest city which, with an easy same-platform change of train in Kolding, will get travellers to Hamburg faster than the direct trains. Rail services shape our mental maps of Europe. The German city of Nuremberg was for years a jumping-off point for rail journeys to the Czech Republic. The range of Czech destinations from Nuremberg has been trimmed over the years, but until last week there were still five direct trains each day to the Czech Republic. Now there are none, although, in fairness, there is no shortage of other cross-border routes linking Germany with the Czech Republic. Berlin now has a direct night train to Paris. Photograph: Sylvain Sonnet/Getty Images Each year’s new timetables create links between communities that just a few weeks earlier were unconnected. Paris and Berlin now have a direct night train , reinstating a link that was severed at the start of the pandemic when the Russian Railways train from Paris to Berlin and Moscow ran for the last time. As of this week, the historic cities of Aachen and Halle find themselves linked by a new direct night train. A Nightjet leaves the city of Charlemagne just after 9pm and arrives 10 hours later in Halle, the city in central Germany which so profoundly influenced the Pietist movement. What better journey for anyone interested in German history? New opportunities Tour operators and travel agents are quick to pore over each December’s new train schedules to create new itineraries. Cat Jones, CEO of flight-free operator Byway Travel , says: “All these new trains across Europe are creating a real buzz at Byway. We’re now able to pair places in holidays where direct trains didn’t exist before. The new Euronight direct sleeper linking Salzburg with Kraków, for example, creates a real opportunity for culture vultures to combine [trips to] two very different cities.” That new Salzburg-Kraków link takes almost 10 hours and is among many new city pairs opened up by the new night train linking Munich with Warsaw. The Warsaw-bound train that left Munich on the evening of 10 December was the first direct departure from Bavaria to Poland since 2010. Kraków has a new link to Salzburg, in Austria Photograph: Antagain/Getty Images In the new timetables, we see many city pairs that are already well served by direct daytime trains securing an overnight link. From this week, travellers can snooze in the comfort of a sleeping car from Dresden to Budapest, Vienna and Graz. All three cities have long had daytime trains from Dresden, but now there is an extra option. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Traveller Free newsletter Get travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian Holidays Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Béziers and Montpellier will now have a direct link with Paris on some nights, with the first departures tomorrow. Here, of course, there is competition from direct daytime trains, with the fastest TGVs dashing from Montpellier to the capital in little more than three hours. Another new French overnight train is the Aurillac-Paris service, where there are no competing direct daytime trains. As with all French night trains, they offer little by way of creature comforts. There are no sleeping cars, so passengers must choose between a reclining seat and a couchette. But prices are keen, with fares from €19 for seats and €29 for couchettes. Crossing borders Much has been made of the fact that Europe’s rail operators often focus on their domestic markets and neglect cross-border connections. The ambition of some rail companies does flag as they approach international frontiers, but there are plenty of improved cross-border opportunities. This week has seen increased frequency between Munich and Zürich, hard on the heels of big improvements in November, when direct trains from Stuttgart to Zürich were reinstated. On the busy Berlin-Amsterdam route, journey time has been trimmed by 30 minutes, to under six hours. There is a cross-border service from Latvia, above, to Lithuania for the first time since before Covid. Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images The number of direct daytime trains from Kraków to both Vienna and Berlin doubles from one to two and the Polish city of Wrocław acquires a new early-morning direct train to Vienna, returning late afternoon. From last weekend, there has been a second direct train from Vienna to Ukraine. Complementing the longstanding Euronight service from Vienna to Kyiv, the morning departure from Vienna to Romania now also has through-carriages to Chop, in Ukraine’s Transcarpathia region. It is a mark of how EU-based rail operators promoting better connectivity with western Ukraine. Czech private operator RegioJet is said to be exploring the possibility of a new direct overnight train from Prague to Chop from early 2024. It is even possible that cross-border services from Lithuania to Latvia may be reinstated before the end of the year. The habitually cautious editors of the wonderful European Rail Timetable suggest in their newly published winter edition that “a through Vilnius to Riga train is expected to start running from 27 December”. If this comes to pass, it will be the first public train service between the two capitals since before the pandemic. And it will mean dedicated rail travellers will once again be able to travel by train all the way from England to Estonia without resorting to a bus for that cross-border hop from Lithuania into Latvia.

        "content": "A female black bear sits in a tree near Lake Tahoe, Calif. In an extremely rare incident, a California man was reportedly bitten numerous times by a black bear in Friday. The Calpine resident told authorities he let his dog outside to use the bathroom as usual on Saturday evening, but noticed the dog bolted. When he went outside to find him, a bear emerged from his neighbor’s yard and “charged at him,” the Sierra County Sheriff’s Office said in a . The bear then reportedly bit the man on the hand, wrist and leg. The man escaped back into his home, retrieved a shotgun and shot the black bear while the animal was in a standoff with his dog. The shotgun blast seriously wounded the bear. Advertisement Article continues below this ad The California Department of Fish and Wildlife subsequently located and euthanized the bear, then took the remains to Sacramento to test for rabies. The man is recovering after receiving treatment for his injuries in a hospital. “The bear had been shot at close range, was bleeding heavily and mortally wounded,” Capt. Patrick Foy at Fish and Wildlife told SFGATE over the phone Wednesday. “The decision was made to euthanize it through compassion.” Foy said a wildlife officer killed the bear on-site with a patrol rifle. It’s an exceedingly unusual example of a bear, outside, charging at and repeatedly biting a human. The sheriff’s statement did not detail if the bear had cubs or if the dog was acting aggressively. “Very, very, very rare. I’ve never heard of that happening,” said Ann Bryant, executive director of the Bear League, a wildlife rescue organization in Tahoe. “The only time I heard of such a thing in 30 years of dealing with bears in California would be if the bear was in an enclosed area with no way out, and the person was blocking its escape route. Then they may push a person out of the way and maybe scratch them.” Advertisement Article continues below this ad Foy and Bryant agreed that bears attacking dogs is also rare. Bryant said it has happened on occasion, if a dog has a hold of a mother bear’s cub. Black bears — the still in California — have never killed a human in the wild in the state’s recorded history. “They don’t pick fights,” Bryant said. — — — —",

        "description": "If you didn’t know, Puerto Rico has become one of the most exciting destination-dining scenes in the Caribbean.",
        "content": "Maybe you’ve heard about the ascendant restaurant scene in Puerto Rico. Most people haven’t: The island is still principally known as a highly convenient place for sun and beaches, with no passport required for U.S. citizens, and the food scene is often relegated to what’s convenient to cruise ship ports. If you didn’t know, Puerto Rico has become one of the most exciting destination-dining scenes in the Caribbean. It’s rich with exciting concepts and heritage-minded chefs who showcase culinary traditions and fresh local ingredients in ways that range from ingenious riffs on Puerto Rican classics to exuberant explorations of Mediterranean cuisine—and even noteworthy pizza. This is all happening in spite of the long-lasting impact of Hurricane Maria in 2017 and the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, those two crippling events inspired many chefs to work with the most readily available ingredients — what they could obtain from the island’s fields and surrounding waters —while also giving them opportunity to cultivate fresh concepts. The creative wave in dining options is surging as Puerto Rico welcomes a record-breaking influx of visitors. As of August, year-to-date arrivals at San Juan’s Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport climbed to 4.2 million passengers, an increase of 20% compared to the same period last year. According to Tourism Economics, travel and tourism brought in approximately $8.7 billion in revenue for the year through June, a 63% increase from 2018 highs. As of the second quarter this year, AirDNA has tracked a 12% increase in lodging demand for the year, while independent rental demand more than doubled since 2019. As the food scene has expanded, both in San Juan and within reasonable driving distance, restaurant prices remain affordable, especially in comparison with other Caribbean destinations such as Anguilla and St. Barts. Here are the seven most exciting places to eat in Puerto Rico, from a fine dining farm-to-table restaurant helmed by the island’s first James Beard Award-winning chef to a wood-fired homage to the region’s cooking traditions. Cocina al Fondo Natalia Vallejo, who scored the title of James Beard Best Chef South in June, transforms local produce and protein foods into dishes that speak to the island’s heritage. Delicately fried lionfish is served in a country bean casserole; yellowfin crudo is enlivened with caramelized pineapple. Meals at her villa-style San Juan restaurant, with its verdant backyard patio, feel like lively dinner parties. They’re powered by cocktails from bar star Karla Torres, who deftly weaves regional fruits, flowers and botanicals into memorable libations. Tia Dora Tucked away near San Juan’s beachy, breezy Ocean Park community, chef Raul Corea’s slim restaurant evokes the Mediterranean. The food, served mezze style, is colorful and creative: Options include fire-roasted prawns, daubed with preserved lemon aioli and served with magenta triangles of watermelon radish, and bucatini tossed with za’atar and parmesan in a reimagined cacio e pepe; entrees start at $23. Vegan options abound, too. The cocktail menu is equally compelling, full of such delectable riffs as a cooling cucumber sumac margarita. Café Caleta Set near the historic Catedral de San Juan Bautista, this charming newcomer is a coffee shop by day and a wine-cocktail bar at night. Don’t ask for any flavor shots with your expertly pulled espresso drinks; Caleta doesn’t believe in them. Alongside is a fun, funky selection of bottles and classic-inspired tipples, including a righteous mezcal-powered Negroni. The food served throughout the day is internationally influenced: horchata-spiced challah bread French toast at breakfast, house-made pastrami stacked on a bialy-like pretzel bun for the lunch crowd and, at dinner, catch-of-the-day ceviche crowned with crunchy peanuts. (Dishes at night start at $14.) La Santurcina One of the newest additions to the island’s pizza scene may be its best. Located in San Juan’s vibe-y Santurce neighborhood, its airy space is decorated with slice-minded pop art and plenty of plants. Chef-owner Francis Guzman and chef Stephen Reyna, who also helm the city’s celebrated farm-to-table restaurant Vianda, turn out beautifully bubbled, Neapolitan-inspired rounds, often with clever vegetable toppings such as their signature Beetaroni, with thinly sliced, sausage-spiced beets. Tables fill up quickly, so arriving early will bring the best chance of scoring a seat. Celeste Snuggled between Old San Juan and Condado in Puerta de Tierra, this chic seafood-centric wine bar highlights fresh catches from the surrounding waters. Chef-owner Sebastián Martínez Tully’s seemingly simple plates have complex flavors, such as cubes of raw yellowfin tuna tossed in umami-packed curry leaf oil and grilled razor clams lavished with arugula-embellished chili sauce. Don’t miss the desserts, including tender chocolate cake topped with a cloud of allspice-accented whipped cream and a drizzle of honey-sesame caramel. El Pretexto This verdant, 3.5-acre mountaintop retreat outside Cayey on the southeastern end of the island — an hour from San Juan — offers immersive property tours and dinners twice a week. Founder Crystal Díaz is a super connector who knows everyone in Puerto Rico’s food community; she hosts sunset soirees that begin with a walk through her bountiful garden and orchard and past the property’s newest villa. The four-course meals by acclaimed chef Luis Cabrero, which go for $75, unfold on the deck with a view of the hills tumbling down to the azure Caribbean coastline. The seasonal dishes blend influences from the diaspora, European colonizers and Caribbean culture, such as chorizo-packed chickpea stew served with a toasted slab of garlic-rubbed baguette from a local baker. Bacoa Three veteran chefs from Puerto Rico power this exuberant, exciting enterprise: Tia Dora’s Correa, René Marichal and Xavier Pacheco. The restaurant is situated in a restored hacienda overlooking a small, stream-fed lake on a finca (country estate) in the town of Juncos on the eastern end of the island, a 45-minute drive from San Juan. The menu, which capitalizes on wood-fired grilling, offers refined interpretations of Puerto Rican favorites: salted cod fritters, crispy skinned branzino with slender ribbons of calabaza squash, and sausage pudding in a glistening puddle of pork demi-glace. ___ ©2023 Bloomberg L.P.

        "description": "US Navy officer Lt. Ridge Alkonis, who was jailed in Japan for negligent driving that resulted in the death of two people, has been booked into a federal prison in Los Angeles following his transfer to the US.",
        "content": "US Navy officer Lt. Ridge Alkonis, who was jailed in for negligent driving that resulted in the death of two people, has been booked into a federal prison in Los Angeles following his transfer to the US, according to a family spokesperson and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. “We can confirm Ridge Alkonis is in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) Los Angeles,” a BOP spokesperson told CNN. A family spokesperson, Jonathan Franks, said in a statement that “Lt. Alkonis is now housed in a notorious federal lockup in Los Angeles, and BOP tells us it will take up to 90 days to approve Brittany and the kids to visit him. We believe the BOP can and should release Ridge immediately – it is outrageous he is spending the night in jail.” The BOP spokesperson said the bureau had nothing to add when asked by CNN when Alkonis’ family might be able to visit him. Earlier Thursday, the Alkonis family said in a statement that they were “encouraged” by the transfer. “After 507 days, Lt. Ridge Alkonis is on his way home to the United States. We are encouraged by Ridge’s transfer back to the United States but cannot celebrate until Ridge has been reunited with his family,” the statement said. Two US officials confirmed earlier in the day that Alkonis was in US custody. One of those officials told CNN that he was remanded to US custody after direct engagement by Vice President Kamala Harris and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, and was being brought back to the US under an international prisoner convention that allows individuals to serve the remainder of their confinement in their home country. When Alkonis arrives back in the US, the official said, “he will go before an entity called the US parole commission within the Department of Justice, which will consider his case and make a determination about further confinement.” According to a Department of Justice official, the parole commission process could take several months. They will look at Alkonis’ prison sentence in Japan and determine what would have been done in the US, and then determine what his remaining punishment would be. He could end up in home custody, this official said. “The Biden administration signaled to the Parole Commission that if they want to understand the complexity of the diplomacy, his military record, the fact that he was a model prisoner or anything else, we are available to do that as long as the Commission deems it appropriate,” they said. The Department of Justice declined to comment. Alkonis, who was stationed in Japan, was sentenced to three years in a Japanese prison in October 2021 for negligent driving resulting in the death of two people and injuries to a third person in May 2021. He said he suffered from acute mountain sickness as he was driving with his family from Mount Fuji, which caused him to lose consciousness. That argument was rejected by the court. His appeal was denied in July 2022. Alkonis’ family argued he was ill, not negligent, and therefore committed no crime. They have also noted that they offered the victims’ families over $1 million in restitution, as is customary in Japan. The Alkonis family had claimed that there have been violations of the status of forces agreement between the United States and Japan during the proceedings of the case. The family pushed for him to be transferred back to the US under the Council of Europe (COE) Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, which would allow him to serve out his sentence there. Under the terms of the treaty, which Japan joined in 2003, “The prisoner, the Government of Japan and the U.S. government must all agree to the transfer,” according to the “Transfers can take 2 years or longer from the time the process begins,” it notes. Twenty Republican senators wrote to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in August asking the Japanese government to consider expelling Alkonis as they made the case that the “full nature” of the situation had not been taken into consideration. They also noted that a Navy investigation concluded that Alkonis lost consciousness because of acute mountain sickness. The family said they appreciated “the efforts of the U.S. Government to effect this transfer and are glad that an impartial set of judiciary eyes will review his case for the first time.” “We trust that the DOJ will urgently wish to end this travesty of justice by immediately releasing Ridge, and we look forward to Ridge enjoying the holidays at home with his wife and children.” CNN’s Evan Perez contributed to this report.

        "content": "Efforts to eradicate female genital mutilation in Kenya have suffered a setback after a police officer was killed in a confrontation with a gang of youths. Activists and local leaders condemned the murder, calling it a backward step in the fight to eradicate the practice in the country. Police in Elgeyo Marakwet county, in the Rift Valley region, had taken a group of girls who had been forced to undergo the illegal procedure to hospital when a mob of young men stormed a police station and stoned Cpl Mushote Boma to death. “Angry youth raided the police post in a bid to get the girls, who had been rescued by police after they were genitally mutilated, where they overpowered the officer who was on duty and stoned him to death before burning his body using a mattress,” reported the government-owned Kenya news agency . The six girls are recuperating at a local hospital, according to county police commander, Peter Mulinge. Female genital mutilation, or “the cut”, remains illegal in Kenya but is still being practised in some places, usually during school holidays , by women using crude methods and tools. There have been cases of activists being attacked by those carrying out FGM, but assaults on law enforcement officers are rare. “It is shocking and disheartening that in the 21st century we can kill a police officer rescuing girls undergoing the inhumane act,” said Tony Mwebia, founder and executive director of the not-for-profit Men End FGM Foundation that aims to rally men and boys against FGM and child marriages. “Were these men who killed the policeman aware of why they were protecting the backward culture? Do they have any idea of the harm caused by the cut?” Mwebia, whose organisation has since trained nearly 500 male champions in counties where FGM exists, says men cringe when they are shown videos of the cut, a rite they traditionally believe is undertaken for their benefit. “They are told the cut makes women more mature and avoid promiscuity. They are also told that they will lose any respect within the community by marrying an uncut woman. That is why they will kill anyone, including a policeman, who interferes with the cut,” Mwebia said. Mwebia was attacked by another group of men in Kuria in December 2016 after he and a colleague were suspected of filming a street parade of girls undergoing the cut. A local administrator, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, said the attack on law enforcement officers will embolden those performing the cut as they will see the government as weak and unable to protect its own. “Killing a police officer in the name of FGM worries me,” he said. “We know FGM is illegal in Kenya but just enforcing the law without adequate public sensitisation against the vice will have little success. There must be a robust conversation with local people if we are to stem the FGM tide in the region.” According to The Nation newspaper , about 70 girls were rescued by the police, with Viola Cherono, a human rights activist from the region, reporting that as many as 500 girls had been assembling in the forest to undergo the practice. ‘Every chemist has a backroom’: the rise of secret FGM in Kenya Read more “Girls are being cut every day in the Endo and Embobut wards. The people in Embobut are very wild and if you are an activist or the police, they will come and get you,” she told the paper. Bernadette Loloju, chief executive officer of the Anti-FGM Board in Kenya, said the killing was “an isolated incident beyond human thinking”, but that it should not be used to gauge the extent of the fight against the practice. “Cases of FGM have come down in communities that were strongly for the cut, mainly because girls have come out to say no,” said Loloju. “Although women are the perpetrators of the cut, we continue to engage the elders who are the cultural gatekeepers. These are the men who are shocked when they see videos of how FGM is done.” Mwebia said the war against FGM will only be won if “we don’t waste resources in conferences but change our strategies”. “There is political goodwill, right from the country’s top leadership. The silence from men will be the biggest barrier.”",

        "description": "Advocates say the separations stem from the federal government's ongoing practice of releasing high volumes of migrants to street locations around San Diego County without coordinated reception plans.",
        "content": "Nearly 1,100 migrant families have been separated while being processed at the U.S.-Mexico border near San Diego since September, immigrant advocacy groups said in a letter sent Thursday to the Department of Homeland Security that seeks an investigation into the matter. The separations stem from U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s ongoing practice of releasing high volumes of migrants to street locations around San Diego County without coordinated reception plans, according to the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy and three other groups that signed the letter. As migrant arrivals at the California-Mexico border have increased, Customs and Border Protection has turned to street releases and holding migrants between border walls to reduce the number of people in its short-term facilities. According to the letter, immigration law group Al Otro Lado documented 1,081 family separations among the hundreds of migrants it serves each day at a border welcome center in San Diego, where it provides legal aid and translation services. Of that total, there were almost 400 separations of spouses and about 200 separations of adult children from the parents they were traveling with, including 43 children between age 18 and 21. Separations of those in other family relationships, such as adult siblings, cousins and common-law partners, make up the remainder of the total. In at least 39 cases, families remained separated after one or more members were transferred to long-term immigrant detention facilities. In at least two cases, one family member was deported while the others remain in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. “The trauma families experience during the periods of separation is compounded by CBP’s lack of communication and the near-total opacity of their practices,” states the letter to the Department of Homeland Security’s office of civil rights and civil liberties, which was also signed by the ACLU Foundation of San Diego and Imperial Counties, and Jewish Family Service of San Diego. To prevent further separations, the organizations are asking Homeland Security to broaden the definition of a family group under agency practice to include parents with adult children, couples without marriage certificates, adult siblings and extended family members. The groups are also asking that Homeland Security agents document all relationships among family groups and ensure families are released together, or to communicate the whereabouts of any family members that aren’t released at the same time. The letter comes after a federal judge in San Diego approved a court settlement last week that bars widespread separations of parents from their underage children at the U.S.-Mexico border for the next eight years. The settlement stems from a 2018 ACLU lawsuit over the separations, including those that took place under the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy that led to the prosecutions of migrant parents who crossed the border without authorization. The settlement doesn’t affect family separations like those documented by Al Otro Lado, which the group believes are undercounted. An April 20 Customs and Border Protection memo obtained by The Times, which offers guidance on processing family groups, states that Homeland Security is “committed to protecting the unity of families encountered at the border to the extent legally and operationally feasible.” The guidance included in the memo pertains to parents or guardians with unmarried adult children up to age 25, grandparents with unmarried adult grandchildren up to age 25 and spouses and unmarried adult siblings up to age 25. Agents are required under the guidance to consider any verifiable documentation acknowledging such relationships and to link those individuals as a family group, with the goal of processing them out of custody together. “If the guidance truly is in furtherance of CBP’s stated commitment to maintaining unity of families, then in practice it should be implemented in a way that allows for families to report and have documented their relationships in accordance with the realities of people who are forced to flee their countries,” said Monika Langarica, an attorney with the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at UCLA. Most separated families said they had informed Customs and Border Protection that they were traveling in a family group, according to the letter, but families were rarely told they would be separated or how to locate their relatives. In October, Customs and Border Protection detained nearly 30,000 migrants near San Diego, up from nearly 18,000 in October 2022, according to agency figures. Meghan Zavala, data and policy analyst for Al Otro Lado, said these kinds of separations aren’t unique to San Diego. But Priscilla Orta, a supervising attorney at Brownsville, Texas-based Lawyers for Good Government, which provides legal aid to migrants, said separations aren’t common in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, noting that Customs and Border Protection drops people off at designated locations. Few migrants stay overnight because even if family members are processed separately, there is little delay before they reunite at a welcome center. Spouses are often processed together, she said. “If you came here you’d have absolutely no idea that thousands of people were processed daily,” Orta said. “There’s zero chaos.” Just under half of the families recently separated at the border near San Diego are from Colombia, with smaller numbers from China, Brazil, Afghanistan and Peru, according to Al Otro Lado. Some separations have lasted hours or days, while others documented by the organization have lasted more than a month. Separations involving families who speak languages other than Spanish are particularly difficult, causing advocates to scramble to find interpreters, Zavala said. Some families spend days in crowded San Diego shelters waiting to see whether their relatives will be released, she said. “Our organization along with others continue to be very strained in our capacity and yet are given all these additional hurdles,” Zavala said. “We try to do our best to get information for these families who are quite desperate to know where the person they were traveling with is now being held.” In one case documented by Al Otro Lado, a husband and wife from Colombia were taken into Border Patrol custody in September. The husband was released just across the border from Tijuana in San Diego’s San Ysidro district without his wife, who had been transferred to a detention facility in Louisiana and was deported before she could speak with a local attorney. In another case, a husband and wife were separated during Customs and Border Protection processing. The husband was released without his wife at the San Ysidro Transit Center and returned to the center for weeks, hoping to find her. He later learned she had been transferred to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Texas, where she experienced medical complications. They were separated for 49 days. Julieta, 38, who asked that only her first name be used out of fear for her safety, told The Times she arrived in Tijuana from Colombia with her 19-year-old son. She said they turned themselves over to border agents on Nov. 22. Two days later, she was led to a bus and dropped off at a shelter, with no idea as to her son’s whereabouts. Five days after that, Julieta’s son was dropped off at the same shelter and they reunited. She said she knew they would be detained at the border, but didn’t anticipate that they would be separated. “It’s hell,” she said. “Not knowing if your son is safe, if he is alive, if something happened to him. All you can do is pray to God.”",

        "description": "An ancient Christian minority in northern Israel, including some who fled from Lebanon decades ago, watch nervously as Israel-Hezbollah tensions rise.",
        "content": "Birds swoop across a valley separating Lebanon and Israel as olive and pomegranate trees rustle in the wind. The flash of light from an opposing hillside looks small from a distance — until a boom cracks across the landscape, announcing another Hezbollah rocket launched toward Israel. Minutes later, more explosions peal through the air, as the Israeli military responds to the source of the fire. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza Strip, hostilities have spread north to these hills, where Lebanon-based Hezbollah fighters have launched hundreds of missiles toward Israeli border communities, and Israeli forces have shelled targets to the north. “This is happening every day,” said Shadi Khaloul, a Christian Aramaean activist, as he stands in a pastoral orchard in the northern Israeli town of Jish. Aramaeans are a community of native Christians who trace their lineage to the time of Jesus. Khaloul has been instrumental in reviving spoken Aramaic, believed to be the language of Jesus and one used in portions of the Bible. Like many Aramaeans in Israel, Khaloul has distant family in Lebanon. “I am worried both for my Christian community here in Israel, and for our brothers across the border,” he said, looking over the valley toward the southern Lebanese village of Maroun el Ras. For Maryam Younnes, the conflict is wrenchingly personal. She was born in a small, rural Lebanese village called Debel. Her father was a commander in the Christian-dominated militia South Lebanon Army, which cooperated with the Israeli army during Israel’s 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon. Many in Lebanon viewed members of the SLA as traitors and collaborators for fighting alongside Israel and against Hezbollah. Human rights groups accused the SLA of systematic torture and abuse of Lebanese prisoners at a facility it controlled. When Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, the SLA collapsed and many members and their relatives fled to Israel. Younnes and her family hoped to stay only a few days, until hostilities calmed down. Twenty-three years later, her family is still there. The SLA members and their families were eventually offered and accepted full Israeli citizenship. She said she has been completely cut off from her extended family in Lebanon, with no communication since they left. “The fact that my family is on the other side of the border, it’s not easy, because I know that they will get hurt if a broader war will happen,” Younnes said. “The southern Lebanese never wanted this war .... And then when the war is over, we are the ones who pay the price.” Younnes said the villagers in southern Lebanon — many of whom are Christians — have little choice when Hezbollah militants set up military infrastructure, including rocket launchers, on their property, which puts them at risk for retaliation from Israel. She blames Iran-backed Hezbollah — the militant group and Islamist political party with representatives in Lebanon’s government — for forcing her to stay in Israel. “For me, and for many Lebanese, Hezbollah is occupying Lebanon.” Of the roughly 7,000 SLA members and their families who came to Israel, about 3,000 remain, Younnes said. The others resettled in third countries or went back to Lebanon. Returning SLA officials faced prison sentences, though many family members were not prosecuted. They have struggled to reintegrate into Lebanese society. In October, the Israeli government directed citizens living within 2½ miles of the Lebanese border to evacuate, including more than 30 towns and the city of Kiryat Shmona. At least 63,000 residents from the north are living in temporary accommodations in the center of the country, funded by the government at least until the end of the year. Nearly 70,000 additional Israelis were evacuated from their homes near the Gaza border. Both Younnes and Khaloul live outside the evacuation zones and have stayed put. But the booms from the exchanges of fire shake their homes, providing a constant reminder of the threats in the north, even though the fighting in the south in Gaza captures most of the daily headlines. Israel’s Iron Dome air-defense system intercepts most missiles from Lebanon, though they have killed 10 people in Israel in the last two months. In Lebanon, at least 100 civilians and Hezbollah militants have died due to Israeli artillery fire, according to media reports. Khaloul said that people in northern Israel fear that Hezbollah will carry out a similar strike to the one on Oct. 7, when Hamas militants in Gaza burst through the border fence and attacked Israeli communities, army bases and a music festival, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza. “If the [Hezbollah] terrorists will stay on the border with no solution, a lot of people will not return in the border line communities,” he said. In Israel, the Aramaean Christian minority is concentrated in the north, in isolated, rural communities that often do not have adequate shelters from rocket fire. About 3,000 South Lebanon Army soldiers and their families live in Israel, many of whom are Aramaean Christians as well. They live mostly clustered along the northern towns, “as close to Lebanon as possible,” Younnes said. The Aramaean Christian community numbers just 15,000 in Israel; there are thought to be more than a million Aramaean Christians in Lebanon, and more than 15 million worldwide. Aramaeans such as Younnes and Khaloul struggle to find their place in the complex tapestry of identities that make up northern Israel. Younnes and Khaloul speak Arabic, but do not identify as Arab Israelis. Khaloul led a long legal battle to recognize the community as a distinct official minority group, and in 2014 his son became the first to receive an Israeli identity card listing him as “Aramaean.” Still, many don’t feel fully accepted by the Jewish majority, despite speaking Hebrew and often attending Jewish schools. “Minorities like the native Christians and Druze, especially Aramaic-speaking Christians ... have no one that can protect them,” Khaloul said. To foster greater acceptance in Israel, he has advocated for members of his community to serve in the Israeli army. Khaloul, who works at the Alma Research and Education Center think tank, helped start a preparatory program that brings together young Christians and Jews for a year of study and leadership training ahead of their conscription into the military. Serving in the army helps his community integrate into Israeli society and connect them with better economic and educational opportunities, Khaloul said. Many worry that the tit-for-tat hostilities on the northern front will expand into a major regional war, roping in Iran, Syria, Lebanon and possibly the U.S. and other international powers. “People are asking me all the time if we will be in a wider war, and what we’re saying is that right now we are below the threshold of war,” said Orna Mizrahi, a researcher with the Israel-based Institute for National Security Studies who served for 12 years with the National Security Council of the prime minister’s office. So far, Hezbollah is showing its presence with rockets aimed at targets very close to the border, but not utilizing the organization’s full arsenal by sending missiles deeper into Israel. Hezbollah is believed to have an arsenal of at least 150,000 rockets with high-precision capabilities that can target the entirety of Israel. During Israel’s weeklong cease-fire with Hamas in November, when 110 hostages were freed, Hezbollah mostly honored the truce, renewing rocket attacks only after the deal collapsed. “Neither Hezbollah nor Iran are interested in a wider war,” Mizrahi said. For its part, the Israeli army is “ready at any moment to go on the offensive in the north,” Israeli army chief of staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said during a Dec. 5 news conference. Halevi added that Israel was exploring both diplomatic and military options to deal with the Hezbollah threat. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah boasted in a November speech that its attacks in the north have forced Israel to divert a large amount of its army, navy, and air force resources away from Gaza, which has helped the Palestinians there. The group has also sought to pressure the international community into intervening in the Gaza conflict by demonstrating how violence could spread into a regional war. Both Mizrahi and Khaloul said that for Israelis to regain their sense of security in the north, Hezbollah fighters must be pushed back from their footholds along the border, creating a buffer zone controlled by United Nations forces and the Lebanese army. Evacuated families from the north have railed against the Israeli government, fearful they will be forced to return to a reality where they are living just a couple of miles from a militant group that is better funded, better organized and better armed than Hamas. Mizrahi cited the Litani River, whose western branch runs parallel to the border about 13 miles north, as a psychological boundary for Israelis. If Hezbollah were contained north of the Litani River, that would restore some feeling of safety for Israelis, she said. This is also the boundary that was agreed upon in United Nations Resolution 1701 , which helped end the 2006 war between Israel and Lebanon. But Resolution 1701 has been mostly ignored as Hezbollah has crept closer to the border in recent years. Militants now operate so close to the border that Israelis can see them with their bare eyes. Hezbollah “is just one mile from our homes, maybe two miles from our homes,” Khaloul said. “We don’t need another Oct. 7 to happen here.” Lidman is a special correspondent.

        "content": "Donald Trump’s potential 2024 bid sets the stage for a heated battle against President Joe Biden, barring any legal hiccups. Biden’s global encounters have led many to implore him to block Trump’s return to power. During a Philadelphia fundraiser, the 81-year-old mentioned leaders from various nations fervently urging him against Trump’s victory. PoliticalFlare states, Surging polls favour Trump for the GOP nomination, with a majority of Republican voters backing him. Biden, facing this challenge, attended a fundraising event, emphasising the USA’s global importance and warning of international uproar if Trump returns. Troublingly, recent polls depict Trump neck-and-neck or ahead of Biden, even in critical swing states. The persistence of Trump’s support amid legal turmoil reflects GOP sentiments, indicating a tough battle ahead for Democrats. The Democrats’ lacklustre response raises concerns. Biden’s sporadic appearances demand a more robust campaign trail effort to counter Trump’s momentum. However, on social media, it seems that the support for both nominees are rather solid. The liberal folks and the conservative folks are determined to support their candidate regardless of what is said about either of them. Will Biden win the next election? Strong blue states like Michigan are waning towards the Republican party. One of the reasons why is due to the economy. Many residents feel that they’re not seeing much improvement under his regime. Democrat supporters are finding this to be shocking as Republicans are generally a lot more conservative, which in their eyes, may not be a good thing for women. Unfortunately, those on the centre feel that both candidates are not suitable for America. They feel that this is what a two party political system does to a country and feel that America deserves better. Be that as it may, a two party political system is more stable than having multiple parties trying to govern the country as votes will be split even further and a majority would not be formed easily.

        "content": "World Inside the Supreme Court’s Dismantling of Roe By Julia Carroll - December 15, 2023 “The intention was to underscore the potential threat to the court’s integrity if such a significant personal freedom was overturned, alongside facing resultant turmoil,” commented Nancy Northup, the president of the Center for Reproductive Rights which represented the clinic. The lawyers from the clinic were apprehensive that any dilution involving the viability line could potentially lead to dissolving of Roe altogether. But protecting Roe wasn’t a straightforward task. Many of those familiar with its legal foundation, rooted in an alleged implicit constitutional right to privacy, have frequently scrutinized it over the years, including liberal thinkers who support the right to abortion based on policy. John Hart Ely penned in The Yale Law Journal in 1973, “It doesn’t constitute constitutional law and barely aims to come close.”. Justice Ginsburg also expressed her reservations about the ruling. During public events, she mentioned that she felt the Supreme Court had acted “too swiftly and too expansively,” and wished the ruling would have rooted in gender-equality grounds. In the oral arguments, some conservative justices showed almost no interest in the course set by the chief. Justice Barrett questioned abortion by suggesting alternatives like adoption. Justice Alito put forward probing questions to Ms. Rikelman regarding the viability standard and history of abortion rights. When she argued that a 15-week limit wouldn’t give women ample time to decide on their pregnancies, Justice Alito brought up a quote from her document. “Your brief claims that ‘there can be no compromise here,’ is this interpretation correct?” He asked. Ms. Rikelman confirmed it was. Later, the justices gathered again for a preliminary vote. Five supported the overturn of Roe, indicating their likely success. The chief seemed to support Mississippi’s 15-week ban, which technically put him in the majority, but he would not extend his support any further. On the contrary, the three liberal justices were in favor of upholding the lower courts’ annulment of the law. Though the chief typically assigns opinions when in the majority, in this case, insiders say it was Justice Thomas, the majority’s senior member, who assigned the opinion to Justice Alito. In his initial draft, Justice Alito stated that both Roe and Casey were not legally sound, asserting that abortion rights have a brief history in the United States and linked abortion to the destruction of an “unborn human being” as termed in the Mississippi law. His next order of business was ensuring the five votes remained intact. Votes within the court are prone to change right up until the announcement of a decision. The swift responses received in February led others in the court to deduce that he had shared the initial draft opinion with his four allies before the entire panel of justices, thereby securing their approval early on.

        "content": "World Mandy Cohen, New CDC Director, Tries to Foster Trust in a Battered Agency By Julia Carroll - December 15, 2023 In November, Dr. Mandy K. Cohen, the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, visited a Fox affiliate in Dallas soon after the Texas governor signed a law preventing private employers from enforcing Covid-19 vaccinations. Despite the politically charged environment, Dr. Cohen showed no signs of hesitation or concern. “Not only am I the C.D.C. director, but I’m also a mother,” she stated, revealing live on television that her 9 and 11-year-old daughters have received their latest Covid and flu vaccinations. She affirmed, “I wouldn’t endorse anything for the American population that I wouldn’t recommend for my own family.” Dr. Cohen has constantly used this down-to-earth approach as she embarks on an arguably impossible mission: reviving faith in public health and in her beleaguered agency amongst a skeptical American public. Irrespective of the pandemic’s official end, Dr. Cohen stands firm on her messaging, five months into her tenure. After the pandemic, the American public’s trust in the agency and science in general suffered a severe blow, especially amongst Republicans. A striking rise in distrust was noted in a Pew Research Center survey, whereby 38% of Republicans expressed little or no confidence in scientists acting in the public’s best interests, a steep increase from 14% in April 2020. Nevertheless, the C.D.C. winter vaccination campaign, sadly, does not appear to be gaining traction. A recent alert warned of potential spikes in severe illnesses and strains on healthcare capacity due to low vaccination rates against the flu, Covid, and respiratory syncytial virus (R.S.V.). Furthermore, political divide over vaccination remains, with only one-quarter of Republicans intending to receive their next Covid shot, compared with seven out of ten Democrats, as per a September KFF poll. Since taking office in July, President Biden’s pick to succeed Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, Dr. Cohen, has embarked on a countrywide media awareness campaign about vaccination. Her numerous efforts comprise of 19 city visits in 13 states, touring 22 vaccination sites, appearing in dozens of television interviews, including NBC’s “Today” show, and maintaining a social media presence with videos titled “Check-In With Dr. Cohen.” She is seen in the videos, often in the company of county health officials and other health practitioners, spreading awareness and endorsing preventive measures against various diseases. In Dallas and Chicago, she managed to converse with the public about the importance of data in health matters and the significance of vaccination, respectively. While interacting with reporters, Cohen often refers to her family. In an interview with The New York Times, she said, “We are all human beings at the end of the day. If we can engage in a real human dialogue about the safety measures I’d undertake for my kids, perhaps that would connect us in an entirely different manner.” Dr. Cohen has inherited an agency undergoing substantial changes. She is dedicated to implementing the overhaul plans initiated by her predecessor, Dr. Walensky, which involves creating a new analytics center and making necessary structural changes to streamline science-to-policy translation. Despite these lofty ambitions, her allies agree that her most crucial challenge would be to alter the public’s perception of her agency. Megaphone missteps during the pandemic by C.D.C. officials and health leaders significantly hampered trust amongst the public. Brian C. Castrucci, the president of de Beaumont Foundation, a public health nonprofit partnering with strategist Frank Luntz, believed public health officials sowed seeds of mistrust by being over-assertive and flip-flopping on their guidance eventually. According to Luntz, his research suggests a significant subset of the public — about 20-25% — has become detached due to public health officials’ seemingly condescending language towards individuals with genuine misgivings. Based on his surveys, a cheat sheet for communication guidance has been developed to help health officials reach out effectively to individuals of all political ideologies. Dr. Tom Frieden, former C.D.C. director and a participant in the project, appreciates Dr. Cohen’s communication approach. “The ultimate goal is to empower individuals with facts, not scold them into altering their behaviors,” he opines. “Dr. Cohen comprehends this aspect well.” Despite a slight increase in flu hospitalizations compared to the previous year and a relatively low Covid vaccination rate among health care staff, lighter news arrived in the form of a freshly released 77,000 dose batch of a new monoclonal antibody shot to prevent R.S.V. in infants. And with R.S.V. cases in Texas also surging, Dr. Cohen intends to perfect the C.D.C.’s narrative around monitoring vaccine safety in response to mounting public concern regarding vaccination side effects. Dr. Cohen is altering how the C.D.C. communicates about itself. During her first appearance before Congress, she described the agency as a “critical national security asset.” Although, according to M. Anthony Mills, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, such framing might not resonate with the general public who are suspicious of government agencies like the C.D.C., National Institutes of Health, and the Food and Drug Administration. “For those who suspect that the N.I.H. lied about funding pandemic-causing research, believe the pharmaceutical industry is colluding with the F.D.A., and see public health initiatives as an infringement on their freedom, such concerns largely do not correlate with national security,” he noted. Unlike Dr. Walensky, who had no previous government experience and was known for seeking media training, Dr. Cohen is not a newcomer when it comes to Washington or media attention. She was a high-ranking official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the Obama administration. After which, as the secretary of health and human services in North Carolina, she advocated for the Republican-majority legislature to accept Medicaid expansion and successfully guided the state through the pandemic. Her nomination to these positions was criticized by more than two dozen congressional Republicans, who accused her of politicizing science. Though, Republicans in North Carolina maintain that their relationship with her, while strained at times, was always respectful and professional. One such Republican, Representative Donny Lambeth, the chair of the Health Committee in the North Carolina House of Representatives, said, “She was always cool and composed before us. She was unflappable.” During her congressional testimony last month, she managed to maintain her calm demeanor throughout. Even when Representative Daniel Crenshaw and Jeff Duncan, both Republicans, put her on the spot, Dr. Cohen skillfully navigated the questions. Instead of succumbing to their demands for regrets and mistakes, she remained forward-thinking and optimistic about her new tenure at the C.D.C., affirming, “We’re in a new place and it’s good news.” New CDC Director, Mandy Cohen, Strives to Rebuild Trust in a Troubled Agency TAGS Agency Battered cdc Cohen director foster Mandy trust Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Linkedin ReddIt Email Telegram Previous article Florida Law Chills Chinese Student Recruitment Julia Carroll",

        "description": "MPP Kevin Holland held a press conference to highlight municipal infrastructure funding the Ford government announced in 2022.",
        "content": "THUNDER BAY – MPP Kevin Holland held a press conference on Thursday highlighting an increase to provincial funding for municipal infrastructure first announced in 2021. The Ford government doubled municipal funding through the Ontario Community Infrastructure Fund (OCIF) starting in 2022, committing to maintain that level of funding for five years. Holland highlighted that investment in what was billed as a “funding announcement” at his James Street office on Thursday. “I'm really encouraged by this funding and I think it's really important to highlight the investments that are being made across all of Northwestern Ontario,” he said. “This just gives them another opportunity to address those pressing infrastructure needs in their communities… so they're not as much falling back on the municipal taxpayer.” Municipal leaders across the province have consistently argued they need much more funding from the province to address massive spending shortfalls that have left infrastructure like roads, bridges, and pipes in some cases literally crumbling. City manager Norm Gale, for example, has called the current provincial funding formula “broken,” saying cities need a new deal to recognize soaring emergency services costs, infrastructure deficits, and other issues. City of Thunder Bay staff have estimated the municipality currently falls short of meeting its infrastructure needs, including maintenance and planning for future replacements, by a whopping $30 million or more per year. The city will receive $10 million through the OCIF in 2024, as it did the previous two years. On Thursday, however, Mayor Ken Boshcoff focused on what he called the city’s gratitude for the doubling of the OCIF. “We're always grateful for almost any amount, and certainly when you get into eight figures of assistance, then we're deeply grateful,” he said. “It will allow us to expand those subdivisions and that infrastructure that we haven't really paid much attention to over the last little while.” “If the rest of my council aren't as grateful as I am, I'll be pretty harsh with them,” he later added. Asked about the ongoing shortfalls in municipal infrastructure spending, Holland said that’s partly due to underfunding by past provincial governments, while suggesting municipalities themselves also must tighten their belts to address the issue. “We've doubled the funding for five years [starting in 2022] to start addressing some of that funding gap,” he said. “All of the infrastructure needs aren't a responsibility of the provincial government, but at the end of this five-year process, we’ll see where we're at [and] review the program.” “If there are the needs, I'm absolutely happy to bring those needs forward,” Holland added. The OCIF provides funding for local infrastructure projects in rural and northern communities, and other municipalities with populations under 100,000. Eligible municipalities receive a minimum of $100,000. Aside from the $10 million allocated to Thunder Bay, the province will provide the following amounts to other northwestern municipalities in 2024: Municipalities can accumulate the OCIF funding for up to five years for use toward larger infrastructure projects.",

        "content": "Ahead of initial production scheduled for 2024, electric RV startup is offering a peek behind its solar electric curtain, detailing the efforts that went into its flagship L1 towable trailer to ensure it arrives as the more aerodynamic option on the market. Lightship is a San Francisco, CA, and Boulder, Colorado-based startup that heralds itself as – designing battery-powered trailers for the all-electric age. It was founded in 2020 by Ben Parker and Toby Kraus – two industry veterans with notable tenures at Tesla. We have followed Lightship since its inception, through to of its L1 electric RV trailer at SXSW this past March. This travel trailer is unique in its aerodynamic, modular design and comes equipped with its own all-electric powertrain and battery pack, alleviating the towing capacity for the vehicle in front of it. The result is a towable EV that will empower future owners to drive further and more efficiently without recharging as much. The L1’s debut last spring did not disappoint, but we have admittedly been left craving more details as an electric trailer that maintains its towing vehicle’s range has the makings to be an absolute game-changer in a stale RV industry. Today, Lightship shared details of the L1’s development process – particularly the keen focus its creators put on aerodynamics – as it works to deliver a true one-of-a-kind electric RV. As you’ll learn about in the video from Lightship below, the startup simulated thousands of hours in a virtual wind tunnel using advanced modeling software and help from Angus Locke, who was the lead aerodynamicist on the . This cost-saving technique helped Lightship analyze the airflow behavior around competitor trailers and compare it to its own electric RV designs, enabling its final concept. The startup’s founders also gathered their experience in passenger EVs to develop L1’s unique “Dual Mode” design, which allows for a roomy cabin with 7’6″ of headroom when parked in “Camp Mode” before telescoping its hard-sided walls down to “Road Mode,” thus reducing the Coefficient of Drag and Frontal Area by 35-40%. Lightship goes on to point out three specific areas it optimized the L1 electric RV trailer: R&D is vital in this process as Lightship looks to deliver a slam dunk on its first attempt to enter the RV market. However, simulations and computer designs can only go so far. At some point, real-world testing is necessary. To truly put the L1’s aerodynamics to the test, it towed an Essential version (no electric powertrain) 60 miles at a 60 mph pace using three different vehicles: a Rivian , and gas-powered . For added comparison, Lightship also towed a “bullet-shaped trailer. Here are the results: Overall, the L1 is more efficient than its competitor, regardless of whether the towing vehicle is electric or combustion. Keep in mind that the data above does not account for the L1 Long Range, which promises to offer near-zero range loss thanks to its own drivetrain system. Current electric pickup and SUV owners are seeing huge cuts to range when towing, making long trips with a trailer more difficult than a traditional ICE vehicle. However, Lightship’s L1 RV has solved that issue, even without its electric motor. The Lightship L1 is currently with $500 down and is priced between $125,000 and $151,500, depending on which version you opt for. Production is expected to begin in late 2024.

        "content": "Family and friends are mourning the loss of Kenny DeForest . The stand-up comedian and writer, whose appearances include performing on The Late Late Show with James Corden and Late Night with Seth Meyers , died on Dec. 13 after getting into a bike accident in Brooklyn five days prior. He was 37. DeForest was hospitalized and underwent neurological surgery shortly after the accident on Dec. 8, according to a GoFundMe page dedicated to his memorial, in an effort to \"remove a piece of his skull and relieve pressure from a brain bleed.\" He passed away at the hospital, per the description, surrounded by his parents, family, and friends. \"Kenny DeForest is and was a truly positive influence on all the lives he touched,\" the statement shared to the page organized by friend Ryan Beck read. \"Kenny's final moments included some of his favorite songs, stories of his childhood, and memories of his extensive positivity and joy for life.\" Beck went on to note that \"Kenny's impactful life will continue on through the gift of organ donation,\" adding, \"Even in death he will continue to make meaningful improvements in the lives of others.\" In 2015, DeForest was included as one of Comedy Central's Comics to Watch and was listed by Brooklyn Magazine as one of the 50 Funniest People in the NYC borough the following year. He released his debut stand-up album B.A.D. Dreams with Comedy Dynamics in 2017, debuting as number one on iTunes. That same year, he made his first appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers and went on to be featured on The Late Late Show with James Corden , TruTV's Friends of the People and HBO's Crashing . After his passing, DeForest received an outpouring of tributes from fellow comedians, colleagues and friends. In addition, the official social media page belonging to Late Night with Seth Meyers honored the stand-up star. \"Kenny DeForest was a universally beloved comedian who died tragically, and much too young,\" the show's statement shared to X on Dec. 14 read. \"His relaxed, confident delivery always stood out. As you can see from his debut late night set on LNSM, he wasn't afraid to tackle controversial topics, but never just to be edgy—always in service of an original angle and a great joke.\" The statement concluded on a heart-rending note, \"It's a shame we won't get to see what he comes up with next.\"",

The big story Gen Z by the numbers Christoph Soeder/picture alliance via Getty Images; Alyssa Powell/BI Have you ever had a question about Generation Z you were too afraid to ask? We've got you covered. Business Insider, in partnership with YouGov, surveyed more than 600 Gen Zers on their beliefs. Advertisement The data, compiled here , provides a fascinating look into the ideology of the youngest generation in the workforce. In many ways, for all its eccentricities, Gen Z is similar to other generations. They're worried about AI. They stress about money. They want a job that pays well. But one area that seems unique to them is their preferred economic system . While older generations lean toward favoring capitalism, Gen Zers are almost perfectly split between their support for socialism (28%) and capitalism (29%). Advertisement It's not a one-size-fits-all approach, as BI's Jacob Zinkula reports . Certain capitalist ideas, like private home ownership and entrepreneurship, aren't taboo for Gen Z. But issues arise for Gen Zers when it comes to the high costs of housing and education, the healthcare system, or the general inequality that exists in the country, experts say. Andy Kiersz/Business Insider Regardless of your feelings about Gen Z's economic position, you must take them seriously. The generation has proven adept at making their voices heard in the workplace and never backing down. Advertisement Millennials largely entered the workforce in the shadow of the financial crisis. And while that event might have made them resent capitalism, they were also happy just to have a job. Gen Z has no such reservations. Emboldened by a relatively strong job market, Gen Zers have questioned workplace norms since the beginning . \"I think now we're just going to continue to push the boundaries and ask questions, like is this meeting an effective use of our time or is coming into the office five days a week an effective use of our time?\" a Gen Zer told BI's Juliana Kaplan and Sarah Jackson . But it'll be interesting to see how Gen Z's ideals evolve as they age and, more importantly, when the economy shifts. White-collar jobs were largely spared during the pandemic, and many junior employees ended up better off financially in the wake of it. Advertisement If a deeper recession were to hit, as some have predicted, that's unlikely to be the case. And Gen Z might find it harder to speak up when times are tough. 3 things in markets Rosenberg Research A veteran economist has a pessimistic view on the latest Fed news.

        "description": "Looking to add a festive twist to your baking this holiday season? We've got you covered with these delicious kitchen sink Christmas cookies",
        "content": "Have you ever heard of \"everything but the kitchen sink\" cookies? These fun cookies are made from a standard vanilla cookie dough (some people use a as a base) but are packed with all sorts of fun mix-ins, ranging from more off-the-wall options such as potato chips to classic fillings like chocolate chips. What makes them unique is that they have both sweet and savory flavors that perfectly complement one another. Half the fun of making this particular sweet treat is that you can get as creative as you like with the add-ins. This holiday season, one way to add some flair to your cookies is to use Christmas-themed ingredients in them instead. Not only will you still get that fun balance of sweet and salty, but you can also add a taste of the holidays to your treat. Wondering what kinds of mix-ins you can add to your kitchen sink cookies to give them a Christmas flair? And, once they're baked, how do you go about storing and serving them? We've got you covered so you'll be ready to break out your creative side this holiday. Prep your dough and choose your mix-ins The first step to take when making your Christmas kitchen sink cookies is to choose a base. You can from scratch, which can be especially fun if you want to get the whole family involved in the activity. Or, if you need to save time, you can pick up a store-bought chocolate chip cookie dough to use as the base. If you go this route, you can opt for either a mix that still requires you to add ingredients like eggs and liquid, or you can use a ready-made dough and all you have to worry about is tossing in your chosen mix-ins. Speaking of the mix-ins, once you have your dough figured out, it's time to get down to adding everything but the kitchen sink to your cookies. One way to give them a Christmas flair is to add holiday M&M's, which come in festive green and red colors. You could also get the same bright appearance by tossing in some holiday sprinkles. Another fun option for giving your cookies a merry appearance is to add crushed candy canes. This will also transform the flavor and add a minty, wintery taste. Other sweet additions include mini marshmallows. Moving away from sweet mix-ins, there are also savory ingredients to try. Potato chips and pretzels are classic picks, but you could also go for salted nuts or even just a sprinkle of sea salt on top of the cookies. The choice is yours! Bake and store your cookie dough Once you've added all the mix-ins to your cookies, pop them in the oven and cook them as you usually would for your chosen cookie dough recipe. Once they're out of the oven, you could add even more uniqueness to them by dipping them in chocolate and rolling them in holiday sprinkles, chopped nuts, or crushed peppermint candies. Or, just eat them as is — either way, they'll taste delicious. You can add further to the holiday feel by serving the cookies alongside your favorite holiday beverages. Rather than opting for the standard glass of milk, pair them with a creamy , for instance, or dip them in a steaming mug of . For those who don't want to eat them right away, you can keep these cookies in an airtight cookie tin for about 5 days. Alternatively, you can make these ahead of time and freeze them for up to 2 months. So, whether you want to make them ahead of time or eat them right away, these cookies can be a fun and festive recipe to try over the holidays.",

        "description": "The men conspired with others to sell eagle feathers, tails, wings and other parts for “significant sums of cash” across the United States and elsewhere, the indictment said.",
        "content": "Two men killed about 3,600 birds, including bald and golden eagles, during a “killing spree” on Montana’s Flathead Indian Reservation and elsewhere, then sold eagle parts on a black market that has been a long-running problem for U.S. wildlife officials, a federal grand jury indictment says. The men worked with others to hunt and kill the birds, according to the indictment, and in at least one instance used a dead deer to lure in an eagle that was shot. The two defendants conspired with others who weren’t named to sell eagle feathers, tails, wings and other parts for “significant sums of cash” across the United States and elsewhere, the indictment said. Simon Paul, 42, of St. Ignatius, Montana and Travis John Branson, 48, of Cusick, Washington, face 13 counts of unlawful trafficking of bald and golden eagles and one count each of conspiracy and violating wildlife trafficking laws. Text messages obtained by investigators showed Branson and others telling buyers he was “on a killing spree” to collect more eagle tail feathers for future sales, according to the indictment that described Paul as a “shooter” for Branson. The indictment said the killings began in January 2015 and continued until 2021 near Ronan, Montana, on the Flathead Reservation, home of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. It did not say how many of the 3,600 birds killed were eagles. Illegal shootings are a leading cause of golden eagle deaths, according to a recent government study . “We just hope that if these individuals are proven guilty that it will serve as a warning to others that we are watching,” said Rich Janssen, director of the tribes’ Natural Resources Department. He said that members of the tribes use eagle feathers for traditional dress and in honor ceremonies. Tribal law enforcement was involved in the investigation of Paul and Branson, but Janssen did not know why it so long for them to be charged. Bald eagles are the national symbol of the United States, and both bald and golden eagles are widely considered sacred by American Indians. U.S. law prohibits anyone without a permit from killing, wounding or disturbing eagles or taking any parts such as nests or eggs. Even taking feathers found in the wild can be a crime. Federally recognized tribes can apply for permits with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to take a bald or golden eagle for religious purposes, and enrolled tribal members can apply for eagle feathers and other parts from the National Eagle Repository . But there’s a lengthy backlog of requests, according to Janssen and two independent eagle researchers. The researchers said that backlog could be driving the black market for eagle parts. Feathers from young golden eagles are especially in high demand, with waits as long as five years to receive them from the repository, said researcher Bryan Bedrosian with the Teton Raptor Center in Wilson, Wyoming. “It has kind of created this market unfortunately” for illegal eagle parts, he said. Addressing those delays could help reduce the illegal trade in eagle parts, said Rob Domenech, executive director of Raptor View Research Institute in Missoula, Montana. He said the area where the birds were allegedly being shot has some of the highest concentrations of eagles and other large raptors in the U.S. West. That includes breeding hawks and eagles and other birds that migrate from the north to winter in the Flathead area. “It’s basically a raptor bonanza at certain times of year, which would make it ripe for this type of activity,” Domenech said. U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials did not immediately respond to questions regarding the backlog of permit requests from tribes. A spokesperson for Montana U.S. Attorney Jesse Laslovich, whose office is prosecuting the case, declined to comment beyond what was in the indictment. Bald eagles were killed off across most of the U.S. last century, due in large part to the pesticide DDT, but flourished under federal protections and came off the endangered species list in 2007. Their population has been rapidly increasing in recent years. Golden eagle populations are less secure, and researchers say shootings, energy development , lead poisoning and other problems have pushed the species to the brink of decline. There are an estimated 346,000 bald eagles in the U.S., versus about 40,000 golden eagles , which need much larger areas to survive and are more inclined to have trouble with humans. Widespread illegal eagle killings last decade brought federal investigations that resulted in criminal convictions against 17 defendants from several states and two South Dakota pawn shops. In that case, the inspected bird parts were bought and sold over the internet, including in Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming. Earlier this year a Montana man was sentenced to three years in prison after prosecutors in South Dakota said he sold golden eagle tails for several hundred dollars each. The grand jury indictment unsealed last week alleges Branson traveled from Washington state to the Flathead Reservation to shoot the eagles. “When Branson arrived on the Flathead Indian Reservation, Paul would meet and help kill, transport, and ship bald and golden eagles for future sales on the black market,” the indictment states. Paul and Branson were not in custody and were issued summons to appear for arraignments on Jan. 8 in U.S. District Court in Missoula. Court documents did not name attorneys for the men, and they could not be immediately reached at telephone numbers listed for them.",

        "description": "It was another blow for Ukraine's war effort, as it battles to retake land seized by invading Russian forces.",
        "content": "Hungary's far-right government blocked 50 billion euros — the equivalent of about $55 billion — in aid funding for Ukraine late Thursday. It was another blow for , as it battles to retake land seized by invading Russian forces, just days after President Volodymr Zelenskyy American politicians to release billions of dollars in aid with a trip to Washington. Hungary blocked the tranche of European Union funding shortly after an agreement was reached by the bloc to begin talks on Ukraine's long-held request for EU membership. Fears have mounted in Ukraine that, without continued funding and more weaponry from its partners in the West, Russia could gain an advantage following a Ukrainian summer counteroffensive that failed to achieve major gains. A $61 billion dollar aid package from the U.S. has been delayed due to in Washington, with Republicans demanding new border security measures and immigration policy changes in exchange for granting the funding. \"We still have some time, Ukraine is not out of money in the next few weeks,\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said in response to Hungary blocking the EU's aid package. \"I am fairly confident we can get a deal early next year. We are thinking of late January.\" Far-right Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has close ties with Russia and has long opposed Ukraine becoming a member of the EU, as does Moscow. Orban left the negotiating room momentarily for the EU membership vote, according to CBS News partner network BBC News, which said the move was pre-arranged. Ukraine formally applied to join the EU shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country on Feb. 24, 2022. \"This is a victory for Ukraine. A victory for all of Europe. A victory that motivates, inspires and strengthens,\" Zelenskyy said on social media in response to the EU's vote. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan called it a \"crucial step toward fulfilling their Euro-Atlantic aspirations.\" Orban later said on Hungarian state radio that he'd fought for hours to stop other EU members from voting to begin talks on Ukraine's membership bid, but said the path for Ukraine would be very long, and Hungary could still top it if it wanted to.",

        "content": "LONDON—The dollar headed for its biggest weekly drop in five months on Friday as the prospect of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve against a tough line from central banks in Europe on monetary policy fed weekly gains in the euro and the pound. The Bank of Japan is the last of the major central banks to meet this month and the question among traders and investors is whether or not the BOJ will signal its intention to ditch its policy of keeping interest rates at rock-bottom next week. In an action-packed week for central banks, traders found more clarity on when interest rate cuts were likely after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at Wednesday's meeting that the tightening of monetary policy is likely over, with a discussion of cuts coming \"into view.\" The divergence between the U.S. and other central banks has set the dollar index on track for a near-2 percent slide this week—its largest weekly loss since mid-July—and around its lowest in four months. It was last flat on the day at 101.94. Futures markets show investors are now pricing in a 75 percent chance of a rate cut in March by the Fed, according to the CME FedWatch tool. At the start of December, there was around a 40 percent chance of a cut. Markets expect U.S. rates to fall by 150 basis points by the end of next year, double the Fed's projections that implied 75 basis points of cuts in 2024. Oil Prices on Track for First Weekly Rise in 2 Months Shares and Bonds Keep On Climbing as Fed Pivot Rally Rolls On The prospect of such a benign rate environment has ignited a rally across risk assets over the past 24 hours, at the expense of the dollar. But the mood may not last, as the U.S. economy is slowing, while inflation is still above target, analysts said. \"There was an element of surprise—the extent to which the Fed has gone with giving the market what it wants. Christmas came early,\" City Index strategist Fiona Cincotta said. Financial markets are pricing in a steep drop in rates, but not the economic pain that might come from the kind of slowdown in activity that it may take to bring core inflation back to the Fed's 2 percent target. Investors are nonetheless still betting heavily on rate cuts from both central banks next year. The ECB has more scope than most to ease, according to Pepperstone strategist Chris Weston, given low growth and a rapid decline in inflation. \"However, the pushback from (ECB President) Lagarde and co suggests conjecture on the timing of initial easing—perhaps this is a function that its desirable to keep one's currency strong to limit imported inflation.\" Preliminary readings of business activity in France and Germany on Friday showed an unexpected slowdown in the eurozone's two largest economies this month, which sent the euro down by as much as 0.4 percent to a session low of $1.0946. It was last at $1.0954, still up 2 percent this week. Sterling eased 0.2 percent to $1.2745, having surged 1.1 percent to a four-month high of $1.2793 on Thursday after the BoE's hawkish tilt. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen strengthened 0.1 percent to 141.70 per dollar, having risen 0.7 percent to a four-and-a-half month high of 140.95 on Thursday. The yen is up 2 percent this week, set for a fifth straight week of gains against the dollar, its longest such stretch since mid-2020.",

        "content": "You don’t read a book like former Wyoming U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney’s tell-all looking for literary pearls. You read it to find out what was going on behind the scenes in Congress after the 2020 election, as Donald Trump’s Republican sycophants and enablers schemed with him to overturn the results of a legitimate U.S. election. You read it to remember just how feckless Trump was when he was in power, and to remind yourself exactly what he is capable of should the nightmare of a second Trump term come to pass. Oh, and of course you read it because who could ever tire of revelations about former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s spinelessness and treachery? God, what a snake. No, strike that. Snakes actually have spines. After forcefully blaming Trump for Jan. 6, McCarthy went to Mar-a-Lago to suck up to the former president, Cheney writes in “Oath and Honor,” because he needed money. Nearly every major corporate donor had threatened to withdraw support from Republicans who voted to object to the electoral college votes. Because McCarthy’s only real political skill was fundraising, she says, he was desperate for access to Trump’s extensive lists of small-dollar donors. “In order to use those lists,” she writes, “Kevin would have to help Donald Trump cover up the stain of his assault on our democracy.” Like many who lean left politically, I have no enduring affection for the Cheney family. They oppose almost everything I support: reproductive rights, renewable energy, the Affordable Care Act, immigration reform, you name it. I was appalled by then-Vice President Dick Cheney’s warmongering and manipulation of then-President George W. Bush. And I’ve never forgotten, either, that the 2012 wedding of her gay sister, Mary. She , but her absence was downright cruel. Imagine my surprise, then, when a tear actually sprang to my eye for a moment after reading about a particularly charged moment between Liz and her father on New Year’s Day 2021. On Dec. 26, 2020, the Washington Post’s David Ignatius with a dire warning about Trump’s postelection plotting. Shortly after he lost, Trump had fired senior Defense Department officials and installed loyalists in their place, an unprecedented move by a lame-duck president. Was he stacking the military deck in order to invoke the Insurrection Act and stay in office? A delegation of senior Republicans, wrote Ignatius, should pay a visit to Trump and tell him in no uncertain terms that he’d lost. There were two problems, however, as Cheney writes. First, not enough senior Republican officials would be willing to risk Trump’s wrath, and second, it was clear that privately urging Trump to do anything against his self-interest would be futile. Father and daughter came up with a plan: Dick Cheney was a former Defense secretary, so together they would reach out to the nine other living former secretaries of Defense and ask them to sign a public letter urging a peaceful transition of power. “Efforts to involve the U.S. armed forces in solving election disputes,” , “would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory.” As Liz Cheney prepared to return to Washington from Wyoming in January 2021, her father gave her a hug, and then, she wrote, “He looked at me and with steel in his voice, said, ‘Defend the republic, daughter.’ “ “I will, Dad,” she replied. “Always.” Unlike many of Cheney’s critics, I see nothing self-important or self-serving here. Liz Cheney is one of the few heroic, high-profile Republicans who were willing to do the right thing after the 2020 election, even if it meant sacrificing her job and her political prospects. Surprisingly, her book is not all grim. Early in Cheney’s first House term, she writes, the loathsome Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio asked her to become a member of his ultra-right-wing Freedom Caucus. His pitch? “We don’t have any women and we need one.” “Tempting as this offer was,” she dryly notes, “I took a pass.” Her recollection of the debate among her colleagues about whether to kick her out of her leadership position for voting to impeach Trump is priceless. Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York wanted Cheney’s head because Stefanik’s constituents were writing letters to their local papers asking why their representative had not taken the same “principled” stand against Trump that Cheney had. (“Many of us who had known Elise since before she abandoned all principle were curious about how she had lost her sense of right and wrong,” Cheney writes.) A number of her House male colleagues simply did not appreciate Cheney’s . “Ralph Normal of South Carolina kept repeating that his problem with me was my attitude: ‘You’ve just got such a defiant attitude!’ ” (So unladylike!) Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania was hurt by Cheney’s early statement in favor of Trump’s impeachment. “It’s like playing in the biggest game of your life,” he whined, “and you see your girlfriend sitting on the opponent’s side.” Female members loudly objected. “Yeah,” Cheney said. “I’m not your girlfriend.” Related Articles On Jan. 6, 2022, one year after the attack by deeply misguided Trump supporters — for their crimes that day — there was a small ceremony and a moment of silence on the House floor. Only two Republicans showed up: Liz Cheney and her father. The following month, Cheney and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, the two Republicans who served on the House Jan. 6 committee, were by the Republican National Committee for “participating in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse.” Cheney, as always, was unbowed. “I do not recognize those in my party who have abandoned the Constitution to embrace Donald Trump,” she responded at the time. “History will be their judge.” In her book, she reflects on the moment: “The resolution reflected a political party that had lost its principles and, frankly, seemed to be led by morons.” Sadly, it still is.",

        "content": "Over the last few years, I’ve been working on improving a portable emergency kit. The basic concept I follow is similar to what DHS recommends , with several days worth of food and water, plus some other odds and ends. I have a backpack for each member of the family, with extra supplies for everyone stored in adults and teenagers bags, and less in children’s bags. Everyone has some food and water, but people able to carry more have tarps, tiny tents, and supplies to share with smaller kids. Some readers may be unfamiliar with why a family should do this, so I’ll briefly explain it. In the event of a major disaster, it’s anticipated that an overwhelmed local and state government might not get sufficient amounts of federal aid to help everyone for around three days. Bungled responses like Hurricane Katrina show us that people could need basic emergency supplies for even longer if a government gets caught flat-footed enough. One thing I do in my bag is try to carry along some extra communications supplies. We probably wouldn’t need it for our family alone, but I want to be able to help other people in the event of a major disaster, too. If communications aren’t available for hundreds of miles, people could get a great sense of relief being able to let family members know that they’re OK. Or, in the worst case, it may be necessary to communicate with people hundreds of miles away just to get much-needed help. Here’s what my setup looked like to be able to do that in 2020: I had a 60-watt solar panel that folds up, a small charge controller, a small LiFePo4 battery, and would use all this to power a small laptop, a Yaesu FT-818 HF radio, and some gear to translate analog to digital. I also have a small handheld radio to put in the bag for local communications. The purpose of the HF radio is to be able to send signals over the horizon. Normally, VHF and UHF radio signals run into vegetation or mountains while stronger signals that don’t run into the earth tend to just go off into space. Anyone beyond line of sight can’t hear your signal because it simply can’t reach them. Mountaintop radio repeaters can help you extend your reach, but a major disaster might knock those out or they could end up being really crowded. But, there’s a special range of frequencies (generally between 2-30 MHz, aka High Frequency, “HF”, or “shortwave”) that can get around all of these problems with one weird trick: bouncing off the ionosphere. My little portable Yaesu radio is capable of transmitting and receiving on those frequencies. Using carefully processed digital modes, like JS8 , I can communicate around the world with as little as 1-3 watts of power. But, all of that equipment was pretty heavy still. The panel was pretty thick folded up. The battery was heavy. But, the rest of the gear wasn’t that bad. So, I’ve been experimenting with finding lighter gear over the last three years. The smallest power station I’ve come up with so far is the Gooloo GTX 280. It’s got 280 watt-hours of storage, and it has an inverter you can plug into it to power other things. It’s not very strong in output, but it’s got more than enough power for my laptop, radio, and other gear. Overall, it saved a lot of weight compared to a Jackery Explorer 300 I was trying to squeeze into the bag. Next, I needed to get the solar panel down in size and weight. 60 watts proved to be a lot more than I really needed, and the big, canvas sided cheap panel I bought from Amazon in 2020 was just too darned heavy and bulky. But, I decided to give Jackery’s smallest offering a try. I’m not doing a review of the panel here, but it suffices to say that it’s far smaller and lighter than my 60 watt panel while still producing around 35-40 watts of power. I only need 10-20 watts, so this works well for my needs. It works with any of the company’s Explorer 300 power stations, but I’ll likely use it with the Gooloo because it’s smaller and lighter. Folded up, the whole setup is a lot smaller, with the panel taking up less space than my emergency rations box. This allowed me to put the whole setup in a smaller bag that puts a lot less strain on my back. For people curious about what’s in the cardboard box, here’s a peek: To save weight and space, I use the little 3600-calorie emergency rations with a 5-year shelf life. They taste like graham crackers, and break into 400-calorie pieces. I have about 6 days worth of these rations in my bag. Add some water bottles, some toiletries, and a few other odds and ends, like a water filtration system, and I’m set up to suffer a lot less than someone who walks into the desert with just the clothes on their back. Eventually, I want to replace the cardboard box with something a little smaller, but for now it does the job of making it easy to remove the rations for times I just want to go play with the radio gear on hikes. I’m still working on ways to get this whole setup lighter and more power efficient. One thing I’m working on is replacing the whole laptop with a Raspberry Pi computer that my folding phone can connect to. This will save a ton of weight all by itself, while using less power. It can also make for easier on-the-go radio operating at some point. Next, I want to replace handheld radios we carry in our bags with Meshtastic networking nodes . These use a lot less power and can provide secure text messaging on unlicensed radio frequencies. I’m the only licenses amateur radio operator in the family, and getting people to get a license is like pulling teeth. So, coming up with a better solution that works with existing things like phones can really make a difference. So, there’s still plenty of work to be done improving the setup further!

        "content": "LONDON—Oil prices rose on Friday, on track to notch their first weekly rise in two months after benefiting from a bullish forecast from the International Energy Agency (IEA) on oil demand for next year and a weaker dollar. Brent futures rose 21 cents to $76.82 a barrel at 0918 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude also climbed 21 cents, to $71.79. Both benchmarks were on course for a modest weekly gain, having been lifted by a mid-week announcement from the U.S. Federal Reserve that it could cut borrowing costs next year. The dollar fell to a four-month low on Thursday after the U.S. central bank indicated interest rate hikes have likely ended and lower borrowing costs are coming in 2024. The dollar index was broadly steady on Friday. A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated oil cheaper for foreign purchasers. World oil consumption will rise by 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, the IEA said in a monthly report, up 130,000 bpd from its previous forecast, citing an improvement in the outlook for U.S. demand and lower oil prices. US Retail Investors Sold Stocks at Fastest Pace Since 2021 Despite Market Rally: S&P Global Stock Market Today: Wall Street Rises Again as the Dow Ticks to Another Record The 2024 estimate is less than half of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) demand growth forecast of 2.25 million bpd. \"OPEC+ production cuts are likely to keep the oil market in balance at the start of 2024 despite weaker demand, which should allay current oversupply concerns,\" Commerzbank said. OPEC+, which groups OPEC and allies led by Russia, in late November agreed voluntary cuts of about 2.2 million bpd lasting throughout the first quarter. Weak economic data from Germany, Europe's biggest economy, and China, the world's biggest oil importer, weighed on prices, however. The HCOB German Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), compiled by S&P Global, fell for the sixth consecutive month, declining to 46.7 in December from November's 47.8, below the 48.2 forecast by economists. Data released by China's statistics bureau on Friday showed refinery runs in November dropped to their lowest level since the start of 2023, as margin pressure on non-state owned refiners saw them cut back production, while sluggish diesel consumption weighed on national fuel demand. Despite ongoing woes in China's property market, the data also showed a better-than-expected performance in industrial output and improving retail sales, lending some relief to market sentiment amid the country's anaemic post-COVID economic recovery.",

        "content": "An Atlanta woman pleaded guilty to stealing more than $4 million from Facebook while she was an executive at the company. Barbara Furlow-Smiles who worked as a lead strategist, global head of employee resource groups and diversity engagement at Facebook, Inc., now known as Meta, from about January 2017 to September 2021 according to U.S. Attorney Northern District of Georgia Ryan K. Buchanan’s Office. “This defendant abused a position of trust as a global diversity executive for Facebook to defraud the company of millions of dollars, ignoring the insidious consequences of undermining the importance of her DEI mission,” said Buchanan in a statement. According to the US Attorney, Furlow-Smiles used her Facebook expense account to live a luxurious lifestyle in California and Georgia. Furlow-Smiles fraudulently used Facebook funds to pay for numerous personal expenses including hair stylists, babysitters, and $18,000 to a preschool for tuition, according to Buchanan. Furlow-Smiles’ “scheme” was to link her company credit cards to PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App, then use those cards to pay others for services never performed, Buchanan says. Related Articles Friends, relatives, and associates who received the payments would then return some of the money to Furlow-Smiles as a kickback, according to Buchanan’s Office. Investigators say Furlow-Smiles would create inflated invoices to pay them, then those vendors would return a portion of the payment to Furlow-Smiles. Buchanan adds, “She even involved relatives, friends, and other associates in her crimes, all to fund a lavish lifestyle through fraud rather than hard and honest work.” Sentencing for Barbara Furlow-Smiles is scheduled for March 19, 2024.

        "description": "The child's attorney said he doesn't believe a White child would have been arrested under similar circumstances.",
        "content": "A 10-year-old Black child who urinated in a parking lot must serve three months’ probation and write a two-page book report on the late NBA star Kobe Bryant, a Mississippi judge has ordered. Tate County Youth Court Judge Rusty Harlow handed down the sentence Tuesday after the child's lawyer reached an agreement with a special prosecutor. The prosecution threatened to upgrade the charge of “child in need of supervision” to a more serious charge of disorderly conduct if the boy's family took the case to trial, said Carlos Moore, the child’s attorney. “I thought any sensible judge would dismiss the charge completely. It’s just asinine,\" Moore said. \"There were failures in the criminal justice system all the way around.” Moore said he doesn’t believe a White child would have been arrested under similar circumstances, and he couldn't find a similar instance of a child receiving a similar sentence for the same offense. “I don’t think there is a male in America who has not discreetly urinated in public,” Moore said. The child’s mother has said her son urinated behind her vehicle while she was visiting a lawyer’s office in Senatobia, Mississippi, on Aug. 10. Police officers in the town of about 8,100 residents, 40 miles south of Memphis, Tennessee, saw the child urinating and arrested him. Officers put him in a squad car and took him to the police station. Senatobia Police Chief Richard Chandler said the child was not handcuffed, but his mother said he was put in a jail cell, according to . Days after the episode, Chandler said the officers violated their training on how to deal with children. He said one of the officers who took part in the arrest was “no longer employed,” and other officers would be disciplined. He didn’t specify whether the former officer was fired or quit, or what type of discipline the others would face. Chandler did not immediately respond to a voicemail message Thursday. Reached by phone, a staffer for Paige Williams, the Tate County Youth Court prosecutor appointed to handle the case, said the attorney could not comment on cases involving juveniles. Rashad Robinson, president of the civil rights organization Color Of Change, said the decision to charge the child didn’t make sense. “Nothing about this case from the decisions by the police, the prosecutor, and the judge makes us safer or is a good use of taxpayer resources,\" Robinson said in a statement. He said there is a “long and unforgivable history in Mississippi and across the country” of a “two-tiered justice system” that offers one path for Black children and another for White. It was initially unclear whether prosecutors would take up the case. Moore requested a dismissal, but prosecutors declined. He planned on going to trial but shifted strategy after prosecutors threatened to upgrade the charges. The child's family chose to accept the probation sentence because it would not appear on the boy's criminal record. The 10-year-old is required to check in with a probation officer once per month. Williams initially wanted the child to write a report on public decency, but the judge changed the subject to Bryant because the boy is a basketball fan, Moore said. Marie Ndiaye, deputy director of the Justice Project at the Advancement Project, a racial justice organization, said the arrest is emblematic of broader issues in the criminal justice system. “Sentencing anyone, let alone a young child, to probation under these facts is sure to add to the trauma and denigration this child has suffered since their arrest,” Ndiaye said. “This is all the more proof that we need to severely limit police interactions with civilians, from petty retail theft to traffic stops and even so-called ‘quality of life’ offenses. For Black people in America, it is a matter of life and death.”",

        "content": "Buffalo and Western New York are known for several things, from football and hockey to its amazing architecture; the Queen City is a great place to live, work, and play. One of the things that we do especially well in the 716 is art and history. Folks may not realize it, but Buffalo has some world-class art right here in Western New York. From art museums like Buffalo AKG Art Museum and Burchfield Penney Art Center to the Buffalo History Museum to all of the public art displays that sprinkle the city, there are tons of great things for you to see and take selfies in front of. One great spot in the area to do just that is down at Canalside in downtown Buffalo. Just steps from the Buffalo River and Lake Erie, you can find all sorts of exciting things to check out. Some of these include sculptures like Shark Girl, the Silent Poets, and statues honoring famous Buffalo sports players like Tim Horton and The French Connection. Thanks to a partnership between the Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation (ECHDC), Empire State Development, and Visit Buffalo Niagara (VBN), a for us all to enjoy. In a big ceremony last week, officials ECHDC, VBN, and ESD unveiled a new permanent sculpture on Marine Drive, near the intersection with Hanover Street. That new sculpture is called BUF and features three steel 3-D letters—the sculpture stands 5 feet tall, with each letter weighing more than 1,000 pounds. This new sculpture was designed and fabricated by and painted by Buffalo's Nicole Cherry. Buffalonians are proud of their city, so we expect the BUF sculpture at Canalside to quickly become a popular selfie site... We have seen how prominent pieces of public art enhance the millions of dollars Governor Hochul has invested in the waterfront. I encourage families to take their holiday pictures by the new sculpture then head to the ice to say hello to Shark Girl and enjoy some time skating, riding the ice bikes, sipping hot chocolate, and taking in the holiday lights. -Joan Kesner, Erie Canal Harbor Development Corporation Board Chairperson.

        "content": "From the final season of The Crown to the latest Mark Wahlberg action comedy, there’s something new for everyone this week! Not sure which new releases to check out? Let us here at Decider help you figure out what to watch this weekend and where to stream it. The end of Netflix’s The Crown is upon us, and all six of the show’s final episodes are now available to watch. On Prime Video, it’s the return of everyone’s favorite strong and silent type, Jack Reacher, in Reacher . And on Apple TV+, Mark Wahlberg, Michelle Monaghan, and Maggie Q star in The Family Plan about a man (Wahlberg) trying to keep his past as an assassin hidden from his wife and kids. After six seasons, multiple cast changes, and a gamut of emotions, The Crown is coming to an end at Netflix this week. The show, which has been a flagship series for the streamer, has gone from historical drama to tabloid fodder with the newest season focusing on the death of Princess Diana and the rise of Prince William. The final six episodes came out Thursday, December 14. Like the book series that it’s based on, Prime Video’s Reacher plops it’s main character, retired Army officer Jack Reacher (Alan Ritchson), into different crime-filled situations that he has to resolve using his hulking body and interior monologues. Most of the cast for season two is new, save for Ritchson, and Reacher has moved on from Margrave, Georgia to California where he’s trying to solve the mysterious deaths of members of his old Army unit. (This season will be based on Lee Child’s 11th book in his series, Bad Look and Trouble .) The first three episodes of Reacher season 2 are out now, with new episodes airing weekly. If it’s been a minute since you’ve watched a movie about a retired assassin who’s been forced back into the killer lifestyle despite his attempts to be a normal guy, might we suggest The Family Plan , starring Mark Wahlberg? In the Apple TV+ film, Wahlberg stars as Dan Morgan, a married father of three whose identity as a former government assassin has been discovered by an old foe. In an attempt to protect his family, he takes them on a road trip to Las Vegas where he plans to keep them safe, while fending off the enemy who wants him dead.
