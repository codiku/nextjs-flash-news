        "description": "Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy has presented a budget plan that proposes paying residents a $3,400 oil-wealth dividend next year and using savings to cover a $990 million deficit.",
        "content": "close Video Alaska man finds himself on the same path as a large moose in Anchorage A cautious observer captures the moment he encountered a large moose walking through a neighborhood near Anchorage, AK. Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy revealed a budget plan proposing a $3,400 oil-wealth dividend for residents next year. The budget does not include an increase in the per-student K-12 school funding formula, but Dunleavy, a former educator, anticipates education discussions during the upcoming legislative session. Other items in the budget plan include funding for staff to address a food stamp benefits backlog. Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy unveiled a budget plan Thursday that would pay residents an oil-wealth dividend of about $3,400 next year using a formula that lawmakers have all but abandoned and use savings to plug an estimated $990 million deficit. The proposal does not include an increase in the per-student K-12 school funding formula, though Dunleavy, a former educator, said he expected education to be at the fore of discussions when lawmakers convene for their new legislative session next month. He said he wanted lawmakers to consider his proposal from last session that would provide bonuses to teachers as a way to help recruit and retain them. Dunleavy blasted the federal government and groups that have challenged oil, mining and other development projects in Alaska , saying it has left the state with choices such as having to make budget cuts, tax residents and businesses, or reduce the size of the yearly dividend. Alaska has no state sales tax or personal income tax, and for years, without resolution, lawmakers have talked about the need for a fiscal plan that moves away from the boom-bust cycles of budgeting tied to the state's reliance on a volatile commodity: Oil. ALASKA LAWMAKERS PASS SPENDING PACKAGE, ENDING SPECIAL SESSION IN ONE DAY Central to a fiscal plan is how much the yearly dividend should be. For years, until 2015, the dividend was paid according to a formula that many lawmakers have since come to view as unsustainable and unaffordable. In 2016, amid deficits, then-Gov. Bill Walker vetoed about half the amount available for dividends, and the state Supreme Court later decided the dividend program must compete for annual funding like any other state program. Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy speaks to reporters during a news conference at which he unveiled his budget proposals for the coming year on Dec. 14, 2023, in Juneau, Alaska. Dunleavy said the spending proposal includes a deficit of nearly $1 billion that he proposes using savings to cover. (AP Photo/Becky Bohrer) The amount has since been set by what can get enough votes to get a budget passed, with debate over the size of the check often overshadowing other issues. This year's dividend was $1,312 and cost about $880 million, with a potential for a bonus check of up to $500 next year if oil prices exceed forecasts. Dunleavy on Thursday proposed a dividend for next year in line with the formula last used in 2015, at a cost of about $2.3 billion for checks to residents of about $3,400 each, his budget office estimated. The toll of inflation is \"taking a bite out of everybody’s pocketbook. So we’re hoping that we can keep the PFD as high as possible to help Alaskans afford groceries, afford fuel, etc.,\" Dunleavy said at a news conference, referring to the Permanent Fund Dividend. AK GOV. MIKE DUNLEAVY PROPOSES $8.3M FUNDING BOOST TO ADDRESS CASELOAD, STAFFING ISSUES FOR PUBLIC DEFENDER The budget proposal is a starting point. The House and Senate will each have a chance to craft their own versions of the budget, which typically get reconciled through negotiations near the end of a legislative session. The 40-member House has a Republican-led majority. The 20-member Senate is controlled by a bipartisan majority. Senate Finance Committee Co-chair Bert Stedman, a Sitka Republican, in a statement said a focus \"will continue to be a balanced budget without having to dip into our significantly low reserves. It’s our job to allocate resources wisely while addressing the needs of our communities.\" Administration officials on Thursday outlined other items in the budget plan for the fiscal year starting July 1 and as supplemental items for the current year, including funding for additional staff to process a backlog in food stamp benefits. As part of the budget for the current year, the Legislature approved a one-time, $175 million funding boost for schools in response to pleas from local officials seeking a more permanent funding increase. School officials have said that inflation and fixed costs like heating were taking a toll on their budgets and in some cases forcing program cuts or requiring increased class sizes. But Dunleavy vetoed half that extra funding. GOV. DUNLEAVY WANTS TO MAKE AK THE ‘MOST PRO-LIFE STATE’ IN THE US On Thursday, some education leaders said they were disappointed Dunleavy didn't include in his proposal an increase in the school funding formula. Jharrett Bryantt, superintendent of the Anchorage School District, said Alaska districts \"are struggling to attract and retain teachers and classroom support positions due to wages and benefits that cannot compete with those offered in the Lower 48. This directly results in lower student outcomes and larger class sizes.\" He said his district has \"hundreds of open positions that it struggles to fill because of how prospective educators view current conditions of the profession in Alaska.\"",

After countries agreed this week at UN climate talks on a \"transitioning away from fossil fuels\", governments are likely to come under heightened pressure to boost regulation and reject further expansion of oil, gas and coal projects. But that could leave them open to litigation under a secretive arbitration process called investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS), according to UN rights expert David Boyd, who has called it a \"major obstacle\" to environmental action. \"When governments bring in these stronger laws and policies, they're ending up paying millions -- and sometimes billions -- of dollars in compensation,\" Boyd told AFP. Denmark, France and New Zealand have all backed off from stronger regulation on fossil fuel exploration because of ISDS fears, he said. In a report called \"Paying Polluters\", presented to the UN General Assembly earlier this year, Boyd warned that the number of claims -- and the size of the payouts -- were soaring. \"The explosion of ISDS claims in recent years, and the threat of such claims, is led by fossil fuel, mining and other extractive industry corporations,\" Boyd said in his report. ISDS cases targeting actions to protect the environment rose from 12 initiated before 2000, to 37 from 2000 to 2010, and 126 between 2011 and 2021, it said, adding fossil fuel and mining industries have won over $100 billion in awards. That could rise substantially, as \"sunset clauses\" mean even if a state pulls out of a treaty it could still face litigation for some two decades. ISDS mechanisms built into thousands of international treaties have roots in the global reconfiguration after World War Two, as investors based often in former colonial powers sought to protect assets in newly-independent countries. Lukas Schaugg, an international law analyst with the International Institute for Sustainable Development, said the tribunals had historically operated with a \"lack of public scrutiny\". \"People are increasingly talking about the duty of states to regulate with regard to climate,\" said Schaugg, who used to work at the International Chamber of Commerce's arbitration court. Now, \"the clash with the investment treaty regime is increasingly visible\", he said. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development says ISDS poses a particular challenge for the energy transition. In an August report, UNCTAD said of 1,257 publicly-known ISDS claims made by early 2023, 15 percent were initiated by fossil fuel investors. Even renewable companies have filed substantial claims, as countries change investment incentives. The Energy Charter Treaty is the most frequently-invoked international investment agreement in these claims. It \"can amplify existing burdens on countries that are trying to shift from traditional fossil fuel projects to renewable energies\", UNCTAD said. Several wealthy nations have moved to pull out of the ECT, including Germany, France and the Netherlands, while the European Parliament has called for withdrawal of the entire EU. Boyd said even as richer nations reduce their exposure, investors continue to use their territory to target poorer nations. \"It's absolutely gross hypocrisy, it's unjust and it's definitely unequal,\" he said, adding that \"jurisdiction shopping\" also allows foreign companies to open offices in treaty countries to launch claims. According to UNCTAD, 65 percent of cases in 2022 were brought by investors in richer nations -- and 65 percent of cases were against developing countries. Examples of claims include two Australian mining corporations seeking nearly $37 billion from the Republic of Congo -- more than twice its 2022 gross domestic product. \"It's obvious that there's no way on earth the Republic of Congo could pay that kind of compensation, if they were unsuccessful in these claims,\" Boyd told AFP. Often, he said, \"governments just capitulate\". Last year, Pakistan agreed an out-of-court settlement with a foreign firm, which waived penalties that had ballooned to $11 billion in exchange for the reopening of an open-pit copper mine. It was seen as the only solution for the debt-stricken country after a World Bank arbitration tribunal imposed a $5.8 billion penalty in 2019. The Tethyan Copper company told the tribunal it had spent over $240 million on the mine. Boyd said the case illustrates inconsistencies in tribunal awards. Payouts are sometimes based on investors' actual spending on a project, but at other times use a method estimating future earnings. Boyd called for the investment treaty system to be reimagined to align with rights and environmental priorities -- and for ISDS to be \"relegated to the dustbin of history\". \"We've known there's been a climate crisis for 30 years (but) we have companies operating coal fired power plants, saying: 'We had a legitimate expectation we'd be able to continue burning coal forever',\" he said. \"Those arguments are being accepted by these arbitration tribunals.\" © Copyright AFP 2023.

        "description": "The passage comes after Sen. Tommy Tuberville dropped his blockade of military promotions on Dec. 5.",
        "content": "The U.S. Senate passed a bill on Thursday that would grant pay back to military officers whose promotions had been delayed for months due to Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s (R-Ala.) unprecedented legislative blockade. The bill, proposed by Sens. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), was unanimously passed on Dec. 14. This passage came after Mr. Tuberville dropped his blockade of military promotions on Dec. 5. Speaking on the Senate floor on Dec. 14, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the bill’s passage signifies the stance that military service members “don’t deserve to be penalized in any way at all.” “Finally, we are able to right the wrong of Senator Tuberville’s illogical, hurtful, and dangerous holds and the massive impacts the holds had on military families,” Mr. Schumer remarked. “These men and women have worked so hard for our country for so long. [And] because of Senator Tuberville, in a really nasty and whimsical holding back of their promotions, they weren’t getting paid. \"Tonight at long last we are giving these military families, families that have already sacrificed so much, the justice they deserve: their back pay,\" he added. House Passes Massive Defense Bill Despite FISA Objections Senate Passes $886 Billion Defense Policy Bill Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) welcomed the Senate approval and said that military officers \"do not serve any particular political party,\" but rather the nation as a whole. The senator and other conservatives argued that the new policy violates a federal law that bars the use of federal tax dollars to pay for abortions, though the Department of Health and Human Services does so indirectly with substantial funding of the procedure to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. The Senate approved 425 promotions shortly after Mr. Tuberville announced the withdrawal of his blockade. President Joe Biden said the Republican’s hold of military nominations was \"politically motivated.\" “These confirmations are long overdue, and should never have been held up in the first place. Our service members are the backbone of our country and deserve to receive the pay and promotions they have earned,” President Biden said on Dec. 5. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes funding for the multiyear procurement of 10 Virginia class submarines and the development of nuclear-armed cruise missile. It also includes a trilateral nuclear-powered submarine pact with Britain and Australia (AUKUS), initiatives to counter Russia in Europe, foil China in the Pacific, and aid Israel in the Middle East, and investments in Space Force and technologies including artificial intelligence and hypersonics. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed (D-R.I.) said the NDAA will strengthen the U.S. military posture in the Indo-Pacific and secure the nation's interests \"against China’s expanding ambitions.\" \"The bill will reinvigorate our industrial base and provide our military services with the cutting-edge platforms and technologies they need to keep Americans safe,\" Mr. Reed said in a statement.",

Russia has a decades-old tradition of legal abortions, with the issue less divisive as in many more religious Western countries. But over the last few months a flurry of regions have rushed to restrict abortions in private clinics, yielding to demands from the Russian Orthodox church. And health officials have doubled down on policies at state clinics to try to discourage women from terminating. Authorities say they aim to improve Russia's dire demographics, despite evidence that restricting abortion does not increase birth rates and puts women at risk. Activists see it as part of a wider crackdown. \"When a country is at war, it is usually accompanied by this kind of legislation,\" Leda Garina, a Russian feminist activist exiled in Georgia, told AFP. The measures, she said, sent a clear message to Russian women: \"Sit at home and give birth to more soldiers.\" The timing has raised eyebrows -- Russia's abortion rate has already fallen \"almost tenfold\" since the 1990s, according to Russian demographer Viktoria Sakevich. Russian President Vladimir Putin said this week that he was against banning abortion, but that terminations were against state interests. The 71-year-old said he wanted women to \"safeguard the life of the child\" in order to \"resolve the demographic problem\". Russia's abortion debate comes as Putin seeks re-election in March and as he projects an ever more conservative vision of what a Russian family should look like. For years the president has offered financial incentives for Russians to have more children, with the population shrinking fast since the 1990s. But since the Ukraine war, this has acquired new meaning. \"They see this as a question of national survival,\" said political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya. And Putin sees any resistance to social positions adopted by the Kremlin as a Western ploy, she added. \"Abortions are now part of it. They think that convincing a woman to have an abortion is way of worsening Russia's demographic problem -- that it is the West's plan,\" Stanovaya said. Last month, Orthodox church leader Patriarch Kirill urged authorities to curb abortions, claiming the population could be increased with \"the wave of a magic wand\". Since then more than a dozen regions moved to stop or limit abortions in private clinics. Non-state clinics perform mostly pill-based procedures and ask fewer question, according to Sakevich, making them popular for urban women. Government clinics for years have held \"consultations\" seeking to dissuade women from the procedure. But new health ministry recommendations for doctors encourage a more heavy-handed strategy. \"There is a position of trying to stop them, putting pressure on them, scaring them,\" Sakevich said. Some regions, she said, even offer bonuses to doctors if they deter women. If private clinics were banned from performing abortions, Sakevich predicted there could be a \"grey zone\" of clinics taking on paid abortions, hitting poor women the hardest. Sakevich feared it could lead to a black market of abortion pills and even backstreet abortions. Russia's pro-life movement was once marginal but the war has created a \"political environment\" to press more radical initiatives, Stanovaya said. It has also divided the Putin camp. Some male politicians rushed to back restrictions, while Valentina Matvienko -- Russia's highest ranking woman politician -- warned a ban could have \"tragic consequences\". Political analyst Ekaterina Schulmann said the debate is intended to give Russians something to talk about in a pre-election period where \"you can't talk about the war or the state of the economy.\" She said authorities were tackling the demographic problem from the wrong angle. \"They should be fighting early male deaths -- the main cause of a shrinking population -- instead of trying to get women to have more children,\" she said. But talking about men living longer is taboo at a time when Moscow has sent hundreds of thousands of young and middle-aged men to the battlefields in Ukraine. Observers fear the latest restrictions could just be the beginning. \"We can expect more bans, more restrictions,\" said Sergei Zakharov, a senior Russian demographer at the University of Strasbourg in France. Abortions could be removed from the state insurance system, as the church wants, he warned. Zakharov said trying to increase birth rates \"by all means, including restricting abortions, is something Franco's Spain or Mussolini's Italy\" did, adding: \"This has never worked anywhere.\" Experts say male mortality is the elephant in the room with Russia's dire demographics AFP Russian Patriotic Youth movement cadets visit Red Square in Moscow.

The high court judge ruled in favour of the Duke of Sussex in 15 of the 33 sample articles that he submitted as evidence in his lawsuit against MGN, which publishes The Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People. Justice Timothy Fancourt said he had concluded that the newspapers carried out \"extensive\" phone hacking of celebrities between 2006 and 2011, even when a public inquiry into the conduct of the British press was ongoing. \"I consider that his phone was only hacked to a modest extent, and that this was probably carefully controlled by certain people at each newspaper,\" Fancourt said. Prince Harry said in a statement read outside court by his lawyer that the ruling was \"vindicating and affirming\". In a statement a spokesperson for MGN said: \"Where historical wrongdoing took place, we apologise unreservedly, have taken full responsibility and paid appropriate compensation.\" Harry, the younger son of King Charles III, became the first British royal in over a century to take to the witness stand when he gave evidence in the trial. The last time a royal had given evidence in court was in the 1890s, when the future king Edward VII took the stand in a slander trial. Harry, 39, accused the publisher of \"industrial scale\" phone hacking during emotional testimony in which he relived upsetting episodes of his life. He argued he had been the victim of relentless and distressing media intrusion virtually his entire life. The prince and several other claimants alleged the titles engaged in \"illegal information gathering\", including intercepting phone voice mails, to write dozens of stories about him. The Duke of Sussex, as he is also known, has launched legal action against several tabloid media groups, alongside barrages of attacks aimed at his family and the monarchy. \"I've been told that slaying dragons will get you burned,\" he said in his statement. \"But in light of today's victory and the importance of doing what is needed for a free and honest press it's a worthwhile price to pay. The mission continues.\" MGN had admitted to \"some evidence\" of unlawful information gathering, including for a story about Harry. But it had denied voicemail interception and also argued that some claims were brought too late by Harry and the other claimants. Harry has long had a turbulent relationship with the press and holds the media responsible for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, in a 1997 Paris car crash while being pursued by paparazzi. Allegations that tabloid journalists hacked into celebrities' phones first emerged two decades ago and prompted the Leveson inquiry into press conduct. It found that British newspapers had \"wreaked havoc with the lives of innocent people\" and led to the closure of Britain's top-selling newspaper, the Rupert Murdoch-owned News of the World, in 2011. Harry quit the royal family for a life in California with his American wife Meghan and now has a difficult relationship with his father and his brother, Prince William. © Copyright AFP 2023.

        "content": "Senate Republicans in Alabama introduced new legislation on Dec. 12 aimed at promoting election security by ensuring non-American citizens are not able to vote in federal elections. Under the measure, states would be given the power to ensure that individuals provide proof of American citizenship when registering to vote via mail-in application. Specifically, the bill would amend the National Voting Rights Act (NVRA) to put in place proof of citizenship requirement for both the federal mail voter registration form and any state mail voter registration forms. The bill relates to Section 6 of the NVRA, which requires that each state accept and use the federal mail voter registration application forms developed by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission but allows states to develop their own voter registration forms provided they meet all of the same criteria the NVRA requires for the federal mail voter registration form. However, the Republican lawmakers said the Election Assistance Commission and the courts have begun interpreting the prohibition on \"any requirement for notarization or other formal authentication\" as \"precluding efforts by some States to include a requirement of documentary proof of American citizenship with the federal form.\" US Supreme Court Won't Intervene in Key Voting Rights Act Challenge Judge Nullifies Election Over Illegal Votes The co-sponsors of the legislation include all Republican members of the Senate Rules Committee, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Rules Committee Ranking Member Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), and Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) In a statement announcing the newly introduced legislation, Ms. Britt, a member of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, said voting in U.S. elections is a \"sacred right that must solely be limited to American citizens,\" and called her measure \"commonsense.\" \"To allow States to uphold this principle should be simple commonsense, \" she said. \"We are seeing certain cities across our nation begin to openly allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. This effectively disenfranchises hardworking American citizens, insults those American citizens who came to our country legally and took the time and effort to go through the citizenship process, and undermines faith in our entire electoral system – which is a cornerstone of our nation that we cannot allow to crumble.\" \"States have the legal right to prevent noncitizens – including illegal migrants and official representatives of foreign adversaries – from voting in State and Federal elections,\" she concluded. Meanwhile, Mr. Palmer said the American people \"deserve an election system with impeccable integrity\" and that both he and Ms. Britt's legislation will provide a solution to protect the vote of American citizens. \"Her companion legislation will help stop the steady march toward allowing noncitizens to vote in elections around the country. Allowing noncitizens the ability to vote creates endless opportunities for fraud, which will counteract restoring faith in the American election process. This is unacceptable. I look forward to seeing our bills pass in both chambers of Congress,\" the lawmaker said. Mr. Palmer's bill passed the House Committee on Administration in November.",

Former Donald Trump -allied lawyers Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro on Thursday stunned users of X, formerly Twitter, with their single-sentence statements that they were obliged to pen after copping plea deals in the Georgia election interference case. “I apologize for my actions in connection with the events in Coffee County,” wrote Powell. “I apologize to the citizens of the State of Georgia and of Fulton County for my involvement in Count 15 of the indictment,” said Chesebro.

MSNBC anchor Katie Phang summed up their letters, that were revealed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Thursday, with one word: “Underwhelming.” Responding to Phang, former federal prosecutor Andrew Weissmann wrote: “To be filed under ‘THAT’S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.’” Others agreed: To be filed under \"THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT\" No jail time, eventual expungement of criminal record, and court sign-off on crimes not being of moral turpitude (so can continue to practice law)--all the consequences for engaging in attempted overthrow of US presidential election. https://t.co/O2aL0F0kLr — Andrew Weissmann (weissmann11 on Threads)🌻 (@AWeissmann_) December 14, 2023 Advertisement They should have been required to write it 100 times — MooneyWho (@WiblyWoblyMoony) December 14, 2023 Sidney Powell wrote quite a heartfelt Letter of Apology to comply with her plea agreement.

        "content": "The Australian government has warned that violent acts by Israeli settlers are “terrorising Palestinian communities” in the occupied West Bank, joining with western allies to denounce an “environment of near complete impunity”. Two days after voting in favour of a UN general assembly resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, the Australian government has strengthened its objections to violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. Australia outlined the stance in a joint statement with 13 other countries plus the European Union issued on Friday. The group, which also includes France, Spain, Ireland, Canada and the UK, called on Israel to “take immediate and concrete steps to tackle record high settler violence in the occupied West Bank”. How American citizens lead rise of ‘settler violence’ on Palestinian lands Read more “Since the start of October, settlers have committed more than 343 violent attacks, killing 8 Palestinian civilians, injuring more than 83, and forcing 1026 Palestinians from their homes,” the joint statement said. “We strongly condemn the violent acts committed by extremist settlers, which are terrorising Palestinian communities.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The US took a rare punitive step against Israel last week by announcing visa bans for individuals implicated in violence in the West Bank, a policy replicated by the UK government on Thursday . To date, the Australian government has been silent on whether it would implement a similar policy but it has conveyed its concerns directly to the Israeli government. The foreign minister, Penny Wong , tweeted on Friday evening: “Australia has joined with more than a dozen partners to express our grave concern about the record number of attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank.” The Guardian view on the West Bank: the suffering of Palestinians extends beyond Gaza | Editorial Read more The joint statement said the rise in extremist settler violence against Palestinians was “unacceptable”. “Israel, as the occupying power, must protect the Palestinian civilian population in the West Bank. Those responsible for the violence must be brought to justice,” the statement said. “Israel’s failure to protect Palestinians and prosecute extremist settlers has led to an environment of near complete impunity in which settler violence has reached unprecedented levels. This undermines security in the West Bank and the region and threatens prospects for a lasting peace.” The statement acknowledged the Israeli government had promised to take actions against violent perpetrators, but called for “proactive” steps to protect communities. “Words are important, but must now be translated into action,” it said. A spokesperson for the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said: “The Palestinian civilian population in the West Bank must be protected, and perpetrators of any violence held to account for their actions.” The Israeli ambassador to Australia, Amir Maimon, confirmed last week that the Australian government had used “official channels” to raise the issue of settler attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank. How Israeli settler violence is forcing Palestinians to flee their homes – video “I disapprove of [such attacks] and I know that my government will do its utmost in order to bring those who are violating the law and Palestinian rights behind bars,” Maimon told Guardian Australia last week . skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the Australian government is aligned with most countries in agreeing that settlements are illegal under international law. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws show Dfat recommended earlier this year that Australia “refer publicly to Israeli settlement activity as illegal under international law”. Dfat officials pointed to UN security council resolution 2334, which reaffirmed “that the establishment by Israel of settlements in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law”. That prompted Wong to announce in August : “The Australian government is strengthening its opposition to settlements by affirming they are illegal under international law and a significant obstacle to peace.” The joint statement issued by Australia and other countries on Friday reiterated “our position that Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are illegal under international law and remind Israel of its obligations under international law”. The statement specifically mentioned Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which includes that an occupying power “shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies”. The signatories also included Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.",
