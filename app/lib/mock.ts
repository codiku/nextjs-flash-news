        'November 13, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X\'s editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content\'s credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread by Aymen JAMLI A crowd has gathered to see off Rose, a loggerhead sea turtle, who labors across the Tunisian sand to rejoin the waters of the Mediterranean. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-1449240174198-2\'); }); For the last month, Rose has been recovering at the First Aid Sea Turtle Center in the coastal city of Sfax after she was ensnared in a fishing net . The facility, one of two in North Africa, is run by the EU-funded Life Med Turtles project, which looks after endangered species , such as the loggerhead, and aims to improve marine life protection by gathering data on their behavior. Since the center opened in 2021, nearly 80 turtles have been treated and returned to their natural environment, said its chief Imed Jribi. The project also aims to educate the local population in places like Sfax, which relies on fishing. "Before, we were ignorant," said 29-year-old local fisherman Hamadi Dahech, who brought Rose into the center after trapping her accidentally. "People ate them, used them for witchcraft, or as medicine and many other things. Today, thanks to (the center) raising awareness among fishermen, she has a better chance of survival at sea," Dahech said at Rose\'s release. "We use the turtles that arrive here for scientific research , for their protection as well as raising awareness," Jribi said. To highlight the natural wonders in the waters off Tunisia, the center opens to the general public on weekends. Malak Morali, a 30-year-old local who brought her two children to watch Rose\'s release, said her son loves the ocean-going creatures. "Every time he hears that there are turtles, he wants to come to take photos and learn new things," she said. Morali said that it was only thanks to the center that she learnt "that the meat is not edible". "We usually say that cooking it is good, but it is the opposite." The consumption of sea turtle meat is dangerous due to the high levels of pollution in the waters they inhabit. Toxins, such as mercury, build up in their liver and kidneys, posing a significant threat to human health. Besides the deadly metals, the turtles often eat floating waste. The creatures can "confuse plastic bags with jellyfish", said Hamed Mallat, a marine biologist. A 2015 study by the University of Queensland in Australia found that the majority of the world\'s sea turtle population was consuming plastic. Every year, around 10,000 loggerheads are caught by trawlers and in fishing nets in the waters off Tunisia, a potential death sentence for the turtles. Life Med Turtles estimates that around 70 percent of sea turtle deaths in the Mediterranean alone are caused by gillnets, a sort of large net suspended vertically in the water. Some, however, make it through alive and at the center in Sfax, it is often the fishermen themselves who bring in the injured turtles. As an acknowledgement of their help, the rescued animals are frequently named after the fishermen themselves. One of them, a frail baby turtle called Ayoub, was fed by caretakers with a syringe. As well as fishing, global warming poses an acute threat to the turtles by altering their sex ratio. According to the US National Ocean Service, if a turtle\'s egg incubates below 27.7 Celsius (81.9 degrees Fahrenheit), the hatchling will be male. But above 31 degrees Celsius the baby turtle will be female, putting the turtles at greater risk of extinction as fewer males are born. The rescue center in Sfax nonetheless has hope and is continuing its work to prevent the death of the species. Before releasing Rose, Jribi and Mallat attached a location tracker to her shell. They aim to analyze where Rose is most active, which could reveal more about her species\' migration and behavior. "She is the one who will protect the ecosystem at sea," said Rose\'s rescuer Dahech. © 2023 AFP',

      content:
        'Jailed Philippine human rights campaigner Leila de Lima has been granted bail, her lawyer said Monday, putting her a step closer to freedom after nearly seven years behind bars. De Lima, one of the most outspoken critics of former president Rodrigo Duterte and his deadly anti-drug war, was jailed on narcotics-related charges she says were fabricated to silence her. "This is a moment of triumphant joy and also thanksgiving," de Lima told reporters as she left the court surrounded by police officers and boarded a minibus to be taken back to prison. "I\'ve been praying so hard for this day to come. It\'s very painful to be jailed despite being innocent." Her lawyer, Filibon Tacardon, said de Lima "cried" when the decision was announced in the Manila court. "We expected the bail solely because of the merits of the case," Tacardon told reporters. "We believe that she\'s innocent -- we all believe that she\'s innocent and all these charges are trumped up." It was not immediately clear when she would walk free. Human Rights Watch welcomed the bail decision. "She never should have been unjustly prosecuted and detained by former President Rodrigo Duterte," deputy Asia director Bryony Lau said in a statement. Lau said Duterte\'s administration "concocted evidence and used the machinery of an abusive state to punish her for performing her duties as a senator and speaking out against the \'war on drugs\'." De Lima, 64, is accused of taking money from inmates inside the largest prison in the Philippines to allow them to sell drugs while she was justice minister from 2010 to 2015. Multiple witnesses, including prison gang bosses, died or recanted their testimonies, resulting in the dismissal of two of the three charges against de Lima. Since President Ferdinand Marcos came into office last June there have been renewed calls from human rights groups, foreign diplomats and politicians for de Lima\'s release. While in jail she has suffered various health problems, including a pelvic organ prolapse that required surgery. In October 2022, she was briefly taken hostage during an attempted breakout by three detained militants. Before her arrest on February 24, 2017, de Lima had spent a decade investigating "death squad" killings allegedly orchestrated by Duterte during his time as Davao City mayor and in the early days of his presidency. She conducted the probes while serving as the nation\'s human rights commissioner, and then from 2010 to 2015 as justice minister in the Aquino administration that preceded Duterte\'s rule. After winning a Senate seat in the 2016 elections that also swept populist Duterte to power, de Lima became one of the few opposition voices. Duterte then accused her of running a drug trafficking ring with criminals when she was justice secretary, forcing her from the Senate and into a jail cell. De Lima lost her bid for re-election in May 2022 after campaigning from behind bars. Duterte, who was constitutionally barred from seeking a second term as president, stepped down the following month. Throughout the proceedings, de Lima has insisted the charges against her had been trumped up in retaliation for going after Duterte and his drug war that killed thousands of people. The lawyer and mother of two has been held in a compound for high-profile detainees, rather than one of the Philippines\' notoriously overcrowded jails. pam/amj/mtp',

        "Hundreds of alleged members of the 'Ndrangheta -- Italy's most powerful organised crime group -- and their white-collar collaborators face sentencing this week following a historic, nearly three-year trial.",
      content:
        "Hundreds of alleged members of the 'Ndrangheta -- Italy's most powerful organised crime group -- and their white-collar collaborators face sentencing this week following a historic, nearly three-year trial. Prosecutors have asked for prison sentences totalling nearly 5,000 years for 322 defendants, who bear nicknames like \"The Wolf,\" \"Fatty,\" \"Sweetie,\" and \"Lamb Thigh\" and are accused of a dizzying array of offences. Based in the poor southern region of Calabria, the 'Ndrangheta is Italy's wealthiest and most powerful criminal organisation, which has a near-monopoly on the European cocaine trade. While it has stealthily expanded to now operate in more than 40 countries, back home the 'Ndrangheta has suffocated the local economy, infiltrated public institutions and terrorised its people for decades. Since January 2021, three judges in Calabria have heard thousands of hours of testimony -- including from dozens of mobsters turned state's witness -- about the Mancuso clan and its associates, which control the province of Vibo Valentia. \"It's an important trial because it targets one of the most powerful 'Ndrangheta families based in Calabria, with international ramifications,\" mafia expert Antonio Nicaso told AFP. The sentences could come this week. Held in a heavily secured courtroom bunker, the trial in Lamezia Terme represents Italy's largest \"maxi-trial\" in more than 30 years, involving vast numbers of defendants accused of being part of the same criminal conspiracy. Allegations include mafia association, attempted murder, drug trafficking, extortion, loan sharking, abuse of office and money laundering. The undisputed boss of the Vibo Valentia province, Luigi \"The Supreme\" Mancuso, 69, was cut from the defendants list last year to be tried separately. Mancuso spent 19 years in prison before going underground, but was captured as part of a massive police blitz in December 2019 in which more than 300 suspected mobsters were arrested. Prosecutors have asked for 30 years each for a dozen of Mancuso's top associates in charge of selecting targets for hits or extortions and maintaining relations with other mafias. But underscoring the 'Ndrangheta's success in infiltrating the legitimate economy, the defendants include public servants, professionals, mayors, and even a high-ranking police official. The highest-profile one is defence lawyer Giancarlo Pittelli, 70 -- a former MP and senator from ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party -- who faces 17 years for his alleged role as go-between with the world of politics, finance and illegal Masonic lodges. Some 67 defendants who were part of the original indictment have already been sentenced, after opting for a speedy trial. The trial's most colourful testimony came from more than 50 former mafia operatives turned state's witnesses -- including Luigi Mancuso's nephew, Emanuele. They recounted long-buried secrets, from weapons hidden in cemetery chapels and ambulances used to transport drugs, to municipal water supplies diverted to marijuana crops. Those who opposed the mafia discovered dead puppies, dolphins or goat heads on their doorsteps, torched cars or smashed up storefronts. Less lucky ones were beaten or shot -- or their bodies were never found. The courtroom is a former call centre converted to accommodate hundreds of lawyers, outfitted with more than 20 television screens piping in images of incarcerated defendants and informants by video link. Initially dismissed as mere livestock thieves, the 'Ndrangheta flourished under the radar for decades as authorities concentrated efforts against Costa Nostra, the Sicilian Mafia depicted in \"The Godfather\" movies. Today, experts estimate that the 'Ndrangheta, made up of about 150 Calabrian families and their associates, brings in more than 50 billion euros ($53 billion) annually around the world, from drug trafficking and usury to syphoning public funds and extortion, with illegal gains reinvested in the legitimate economy. Italy has made inroads in recent years, training police departments around the world to recognise the 'Ndrangheta on their turf -- and make arrests. But one crackdown is not likely to dramatically hinder the 'Ndrangheta, said Nicaso, citing the need for jobs, education and changing mentalities. \"That's what you need to challenge a criminal organisation.\" ams/ar/gv/yad",

      content:
        'Asian markets were mixed Monday ahead of key US inflation data later in the week, with traders still concerned the Federal Reserve could lift interest rates again. Decision-makers at the central bank lined up last week to warn that more tightening could be needed to bring prices under control, tempering optimism that the hiking cycle had come to an end. That sparked a sell-off in Asia on Friday, though a tech-led surge on Wall Street provided traders some support on Monday. But with focus firmly on the consumer price index and retail sales later in the week, gains were limited. "The forthcoming CPI report holds the potential to reintroduce the possibility of a rate hike," said Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management. "Presently, the market has largely discounted the likelihood of another increase. "While it was previously suggested that an aberrant inflation overshoot would be necessary to make the upcoming policy gathering next month uncertain, this week\'s data... may indicate that the risks are still leaning towards a sustained higher inflation plateau." Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai,Taipei and Jakarta were up but Seoul, Sydney, Mumbai, Bangkok, Manila and Wellington were in the red. Fears that global rates could remain elevated for an extended period were fanned by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, who on Friday forecast a resurgence of inflation. She also said officials would not start cutting rates for at least "the next couple of quarters". Expectations that US borrowing costs will not come down anytime soon boosted the dollar, with traders keeping an eye on its movement against the yen after Japanese authorities warned they could intervene to support their currency. However, Sonal Desai at Franklin Templeton said the Bank of Japan would likely shift from its ultra-loose monetary policy, giving the yen a much-needed lift. "We are going to see a change in policy in Japan and that is going to make the yen attractive," she told Bloomberg Television. "The BoJ will ultimately be pushed towards changing its own interest rate stance which will bring money back." Investors will also be watching a planned meeting between US President Joe Biden and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in San Francisco later in the week amid signs tensions were easing between the economic superpowers. Helen Zhu, of Nan Fung Trinity, told Bloomberg TV: "We are not expecting a love fest or any kind of fantastic outcome or permanent solution but there could be a graceful period of time going into the US election next year."

      content:
        'Thousands of people remained trapped in Gaza\'s largest hospital Monday, where evacuations have been hampered by fierce fighting between Israeli and Hamas forces. Conditions are worsening for hundreds of patients and thousands of others sheltering around Al-Shifa hospital -- which has become the focus in the five-week-old war. On Sunday, witnesses at the Gaza City hospital told AFP that "violent fighting" raged throughout the night. As the clatter of small arms fire and aerial bombardments echoed across the sprawling complex, doctors reported two babies died when power to their incubators was cut. Israel says that Hamas militants -- who killed 1,200 people during the October 7 attacks that sparked the war -- have deliberately based an operational headquarters at the facility and in an underground tunnel complex. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other UN agencies warned that as many as 3,000 patients and staff are sheltering inside without adequate fuel, water or food. "Regrettably, the hospital is not functioning as a hospital anymore," said WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, after making contact with on-the-ground staff. "It\'s been three days without electricity, without water," he said, describing the situation inside as "dire and perilous." Youssef Abu Rish, deputy health minister in the Hamas government, on Sunday said three more premature babies had died along with six other patients who had been in critical condition. "We fear the toll will rise further by morning," he said. Israel is facing intense international pressure to minimise civilian suffering amid a massive air and ground operation that Hamas authorities say has already killed 11,180 people, including 4,609 children. Foreign officials like EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell have urged Israel to show "maximum restraint", while condemning Hamas for using "hospitals and civilians as human shields." Israel\'s military said it would observe a "self-evacuation corridor" Monday, allowing people to move from Al-Shifa southward, but admitted the area was still the scene of "intense battles." The area of fighting "currently includes the area surrounding the Shifa hospital but not the hospital itself", a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces told AFP. Tens of thousands of Gazans have already fled from the north of the territory under Israeli orders. But it is unclear what, if any, provisions there would be for the sick and injured to be transported from Al-Shifa. The Israeli army also said its ground soldiers had hand-delivered 300 litres of fuel to the hospital "for urgent medical purposes". The military shared grainy night-time footage of combat troops hauling jerry cans, leaving a dozen or more outside a building. AFP was unable to independently verify the footage, or Israel\'s claim that Hamas "forbade the hospital from taking it." Only a handful of trucks carrying fuel had been let into Gaza since October 7, with Israel concerned fuel deliveries would be used by Hamas militants. Al-Shifa director Mohammad Abu Salmiya told journalists the Israeli claims were "lies". The 300 litres the army said had been delivered would power generators for "no more than quarter of an hour" anyway, Abu Salmiya said. Inside the hospital, AFP last week witnessed the sick and injured on gurneys that packed corridor walls. The courtyard of the emergency ward was dotted with people and piles of rubbish lay uncollected. Some of the thousands displaced by the fighting camped at the facility using make-shift kitchens and what few supplies they had. Across Gaza City at the Al-Quds hospital the picture was also said to be dire, with the Palestinian Red Crescent warning it was now out of service due to a lack of generator fuel. Twenty of Gaza\'s 36 hospitals are "no longer functioning", according to the UN\'s humanitarian agency. Almost 1.6 million people -- about two-thirds of Gaza\'s population -- have been internally displaced since October 7, according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA. Israel\'s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out calls for the ceasefire, saying Hamas must first release the estimated 240 hostages taken on October 7. Israelis are still stunned by the worst attack in their country\'s history and preoccupied with the fate of those still missing. A recent poll by the Israel Democracy Institute showed many Israelis back talks with Hamas to secure the release of hostages, but believe fighting should not be halted. Netanyahu told US media that "there could be" a deal to free the hostages, but stopped short of providing any details. "The less I say about it, the more I\'ll increase the chances that it materialises," he told NBC. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told MSNBC there has been "active negotiation" on a potential deal but kept mum on any details, while a Palestinian official in Gaza accused Israel of dragging its feet. "Netanyahu is responsible for the delay and obstacles in reaching a preliminary agreement on the release of several prisoners," the official told AFP on condition of anonymity. burs-arb/ser',

        'Seventeen-year-old Yavezi Alvarado wakes up early to get her backpack ready for school -- but she also has to prepare bottles for her one-year-old daughter, Kamila, who rides on the school bus with her. "When I wake up I have to get her Pampers ready, her wipes, her milk... And mostly clothes. Because, I mean, she gets dirty," said the Brownsville, Texas teen. The bus has safety seats for infants, who ride with their young mothers to Lincoln Park High School in a low-income Hispanic neighborhood just miles from the border with Mexico. The school takes girls and women aged 14 to 22 who are pregnant or have recently given birth. While they attend classes, a childcare center in the same school watches the little ones. Mothers can go there to nurse their babies whenever necessary. Knowing her daughter is nearby and is being well cared for makes a huge difference, Alvarado said. Texas is one of several conservative states that have banned abortion in the year and a half since the US Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade, the ruling that for a half-century had protected American women\'s abortion rights. That reversal has made child care an increasingly sensitive issue, though one that school officials are loath to discuss. In Texas, minors\' access to contraceptives requires authorization from an adult, and sex education is not mandatory in schools. Alvarado gets help from her mother, but some of her friends have faced discrimination in their old schools or rejection by family members and live with their child\'s father or other relatives. According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the birth rate among adolescents (aged 15 to 19) fell by three percent in 2022 compared to the previous year, and is a full 78 percent lower than the 1991 rate. But in Texas, the birth rate among young Hispanic women was 2.4 times higher than that of young white women, according to 2021 data from the NGO Healthy Futures of Texas. Teen pregnancies are not going to go away, said Cynthia Cardenas, principal of the all-girls school in Brownsville. "It\'s something that we should have a plan for." Inadequate access to healthcare, and low levels of education and family income can all contribute to high birth rates among teens and young women, according to the CDC. A few former Lincoln Park students have returned years later to bring their daughters -- now pregnant -- to school. "They need to be told, constantly reminded that being pregnant is not a disability, it\'s a condition, it\'s a nine-month condition... and you have that opportunity to be successful," Cardenas said. The school\'s daycare center now tends to 16 infants, its maximum capacity, with several others on a waiting list. Established in the 1990s, the school is one of a few of its kind in the US. The staff and teachers understand that students may miss the occasional checkup because of a doctor\'s appointment or after a bad night caring for their babies. "If this school didn\'t exist," said Cardenas, "my 53 students that are here now would potentially drop out of school." According to the NGO Child Trends, 53 percent of adolescent women who become mothers finish school, while 90 percent of those who are not mothers do so. Classes at Lincoln Park are in English but the population -- living just minutes from the Mexican border -- is mostly bilingual. Students who have to stay home after giving birth are visited by their teachers. And the school, which has state funding, has a specialized nurse on staff. "Here, they don\'t give me homework, I finish everything in school. And I spend more time with my daughter," said Lavezi Alvarado. Teachers treat their students with understanding. Science teacher GeorgeAna Wilson said that she sometimes sees a student struggling because "the baby was up all night long, the baby was sick." "And I say, \'You know what? Take a 10-minute power nap.\' That\'s something you wouldn\'t see in a normal school." "In regular schools they wouldn\'t understand your situation," said Milla Luevano, another 17-year-old student. "And here they do, they don\'t judge you, they help you, they communicate with you. And they understand your situation." Luevano, whose dream is to be a teacher, said she urges other young women who become pregnant to stay in school. "Don\'t give up, because that is something you are going to regret later on -- because you want a future," she said. Alvarado wants to be a gynecologist someday, and says sticking with school is worth the effort. "Just don\'t give up, because your kid needs you," she said. "And that little baby is your life now." mav/bbk/st',

        "The United States will treat Russia as a full participant in this week's Asia-Pacific summit in San Francisco, despite US efforts to isolate Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, a senior official said Sunday. With a visit by President Vladimir Putin politically unthinkable, Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk will represent Russia at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit taking place between 11 and 17 November. \"He's being treated as the head of delegation, and he'll have the opportunity to participate fully in the week's events,\" Matt Murray, the US State Department official in charge of APEC, told AFP. Overchuk is under a variety of Western sanctions including from the European Union but not specifically under US sanctions, unlike much of Russia's top brass. \"We've been consistently saying all year long that we wanted to be good hosts of APEC,\" Murray said of the 21-member organization. \"But we were going to do so within the laws and regulations of the United States. And Russia's participation, obviously, has been shaped by that, because of the sanctions,\" he said. He acknowledged that Overchuk \"clearly won't be on the same level\" in diplomatic protocol as heads of state and government who are coming to APEC. The leaders include another frequent US adversary, Chinese President Xi Jinping, who will meet Wednesday with US President Joe Biden. The United States has voiced hope for stabilizing relations with China and finding limited areas of cooperation. In contrast, the United States has refused most contact with Russia since Putin defied US warnings and launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, spurring billions of dollars in US and other Western assistance to Kyiv. Putin faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court and sat out summits this year in South Africa and India -- both far friendlier to Russia than the United States -- although he recently traveled to China. The State Department last month publicly made clear it would not welcome Putin in San Francisco, leading Russia to reply that it was up to each APEC member to determine its own representation. sct/hg/st/sn/dva",

        "Fresno Pacific University’s East Hall freshman housing building is shown in this photo from the university. Fresno Pacific University is eliminating 16 programs in hope of realigning operations to enhance student success and financial health The university will no longer enroll students in 16 programs that have historically had low enrollment vs. costs, indicating lack of student interest. The 88 students affected—about 3% of the 2023-24 enrollment of 2,912—will be offered the classes and resources they need to complete their degrees on time. “We are in a dynamic and complex time in higher education,” said FPU President André Stephens, Ph.D. “A season that calls for courageous leadership to face the historic challenges and emerging opportunities before us. A season that calls us to renew our imagination and cast our vision to see the students of the Central Valley and beyond achieve their dreams. Our renewed focus must be on providing an excellent, holistic, biblically integrated education.” Decisions on which programs to suspend were informed by data and based on criteria developed in consultation with a committee of deans, faculty and staff, according to a news release. The board of trustees affirmed the plan at its meetings October 27-28. The affected programs are: Traditional undergraduate affected include: arts administration; biblical/theological studies; chemistry B.A. and B.S.; graphic design; mathematics B.A. and B.S.; applied mathematics; philosophy; political science; pre-law; Spanish and theater. The computer information systems bachelor’s degree completion program and graduate/seminary Master of Arts degrees in sports administration and theology, Old Testament are also affected. Courses in many of these areas will still be available to fulfill general education requirements and requirements in other majors, according to the release. Suspending these programs and reducing faculty in others will mean 11 faculty will end their employment with the university in June 2024. These positions represent about 10% of 109 regular faculty members. In addition, 12 faculty positions that are either term, currently open or will become open due to retirement will not be filled. All affected faculty have been notified and students in the programs are being contacted personally. “We realize these changes are painful and involve people who have dedicated their lives and careers to support FPU. We pray for the beloved colleagues who are affected by these changes. We are forever grateful for their kingdom service at Fresno Pacific and for the enduring contributions they have made to the lives of our students and alumni,” Stephens said. To streamline academic procedures, the university will consolidate its current five schools—the School of Business, the School of Education, the School of Natural Sciences, Fresno Pacific Biblical Seminary and the School of Humanities, Religion and Social Sciences—into two: a School of Arts and Sciences and a School of Graduate and Professional Studies. Many challenges to the university mirror those faced by other colleges and universities, according to the release, including Christian institutions in California and across the United States, such as smaller numbers of traditional-aged students, increased economic insecurity felt by individuals and families, lingering effects of the pandemic and increasing doubt by some about the value vs. cost of a four-year degree. Enrollment in the university’s bachelor’s degree completion programs has also been affected by years of declining enrollment in California community colleges. The academic realignment will help deal with a projected deficit as well as focus on areas of student interest, including bachelor’s degree completion programs in business management, liberal arts and criminology and master’s degree programs in teacher education, nursing and school psychology/counseling. The university will also be able to free up resources to improve the student experience and explore new academic programs. These changes also build on recent positive enrollment trends. After losing over 1,000 students since 2020, both traditional undergraduate and graduate enrollment rose in the fall of 2023. For traditional undergraduates—generally students 18-22 year of age who just graduated high school or are transferring from community college—the 10% increase was the first in 10 years. “FPU continues to look for ways to innovate and plan for what is next,” Stephens said. “I am convinced amidst the challenges we face that these steps move us closer to the goal of being a financially sustainable institution focused on the success of our students.” Fresno Pacific University is eliminating 16 programs in hope of (AP) — What's koi got to do with it?

      'Scientists have dated the birth of the solar system to about 4.57 billion years ago. About 60 million years later a "giant impact" collision between the infant Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia created the moon.',
    content: `November 12, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source written by researcher(s) proofread by David Rothery, The Conversation Scientists have dated the birth of the solar system to about 4.57 billion years ago. About 60 million years later a "giant impact" collision between the infant Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia created the moon. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1449240174198-2'); }); Now, new research suggests that the remains of the large object that collided with the young Earth to form the moon are still identifiable deep within the planet as two large lumps. These lumps make up about 8% of the volume of the Earth's mantle , which is the rocky zone between the Earth's iron core and its crust. The new study, led by Qian Yuan of Arizona State University and Caltech, argues that the heat generated by this collision was not enough to melt the whole of the Earth's mantle, so the innermost mantle remained solid. Consequently, the researchers say, the melted mantle of Theia didn't completely mix with Earth's mantle. That would have made the Theia remnants indistinguishable from Earth's mantle as a whole. Instead, a lot of Theia's mantle ended up as two continent-sized lumps that now sit on top of the Earth's core-mantle boundary . Yuan argues that these lumps correspond to, and can explain, the existence of the two large low-velocity provinces (LLVPs), that were discovered decades ago: one below the Pacific and another below Africa and the eastern Atlantic. A high resolution computer simulation of Theia colliding with the earth to form the moon. Credit: NASA This discovery was thanks to the observation that the vibrations emanating from earthquakes, known as seismic waves, travel through these regions slightly more slowly than through "normal" lower mantle. Previous explanations of the LLVPs include that each is a deep accumulation of subducted oceanic plates (where plate tectonics has dragged the ocean floor down beneath a continent). Or that they are a place where anomalously hot lower mantle is beginning to rise as a " superplume " (huge jets of partially molten rock). However, neither of those models can account for a peculiar enrichment in volatile elements such as helium and xenon in lava that has erupted at oceanic islands above LLVPs. Yuan argues these are "fingerprints" of Theia's growth within the gas and dust surrounding the young sun before it collided with Earth. Computer models run by Yuan's team suggest that the giant impact that formed the moon would have not delivered enough energy to melt the whole of the Earth's mantle. Instead, the melted remains of Theia's mantle, which was slightly richer in iron (making it denser than Earth's mantle) ended up at the base of the temporary magma ocean created by the collision. Later, after the magma ocean had solidified, the Theia material was drawn into the lower part of Earth's mantle by convection currents , which flow at rates of centimeters per year even within the solid mantle. Caltech’s Qian Yuan explains by means of computer simulations. It may have taken billions of years for these convection currents to heap up the Theia material into the LLVPs that we see today. Even if this is true, they should not be thought of as vast chunks of Theia's mantle that survived the impact. Rather, they are made of initially dispersed Theia mantle material that has been gathered up again. Most scientists will take a lot of convincing when it comes to this theory. Yuan predicts that if his hypothesis is correct, samples of the moon's mantle, collected by future missions , will match the geochemical fingerprints found in volcanic rock from the LLVPs. I think that that proof will be a long time coming. I also note that Yuan's modeling seems to be silent on the fate of Theia's core. Scientists usually assume Theia's core merged with Earth's core in the hours after the collision . It is not clear how that could have happened if the lower part of Earth's mantle remained solid. On the other hand, Theia's impact happened so soon after the Earth itself was formed (probably by a series of separate collisions) that the Earth's interior could still have been hot and molten in the aftermath of those events. The implications of Yuan's model are worth thinking about. For one thing, would the slow heaping up of Theia mantle material into the LLVPs have had any effect of on the pattern of plate tectonics high above? Possibly we would not have had an Atlantic ocean today had Theia not slammed into the proto-Earth four and a half billion years ago.

      "Back Print By Biswajeet Banerjee - Associated Press - Sunday, November 12, 2023 LUCKNOW, India — Millions of Indians celebrated Diwali on Sunday with a new Guinness World Record number of bright earthen oil lamps as concerns about air pollution soared in the South Asian country. Across the country, dazzling multi-colored lights decked homes and streets as devotees celebrated the annual Hindu festival of light symbolizing the victory of light over darkness. But the spectacular and much-awaited massive lighting of the oil lamps took place — as usual —at Saryu River, in Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh state, the birthplace of their most revered deity, the god Ram. At dusk on Saturday, devotees lit over 2.22 million lamps and kept them burning for 45 minutes as Hindu religious hymns filled the air at the banks of the river, setting a new world Record. Last year, over 1.5 million earthen lamps were lit. After counting the lamps, Guinness Book of World Records representatives presented a record certificate to the state’s top elected official Yogi Adityanath. Over 24,000 volunteers, mostly college students, helped prepare for the new record, said Pratibha Goyal, vice-chancellor of Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh University, in Ayodhya. Diwali , a national holiday across India , is celebrated by socializing and exchanging gifts with family and friends. Many light earthen oil lamps or candles, and fireworks are set off as part of the celebrations. In the evening, a special prayer is dedicated to the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, who is believed to bring luck and prosperity. Over the weekend, authorities ran extra trains to accommodate the huge numbers trying to reach their hometowns to join family celebrations. The festival came as worries about air quality in India rose. A “hazardous” 400-500 level was recorded on the air quality index last week, more than 10 times the global safety threshold, which can cause acute and chronic bronchitis and asthma attacks. But on Saturday, unexpected rain and a strong wind improved the levels to 220, according to the government-run Central Pollution Control Board. Air pollution level is expected to soar again after the celebrations end Sunday night because of the fireworks used. Last week, officials in New Delhi shut down primary schools and banned polluting vehicles and construction work in an attempt to reduce the worst haze and smog of the season, which has posed respiratory problems for people and enveloped monuments and high-rise buildings in and around India ‘s capital. Authorities deployed water sprinklers and anti-smog guns to control the haze and many people used masks to escape the air pollution. New Delhi tops the list almost every year among the many Indian cities with poor air quality, particularly in the winter, when the burning of crop residues in neighboring states coincides with cooler temperatures that trap deadly smoke. Some Indian states have banned the sale of fireworks and imposed other restrictions to stem the pollution. Authorities have also urged residents to light “green crackers” that emit less pollutants than normal firecrackers. But similar bans have often been disregarded in the past. The Diwali celebrations this year were marked as authorities prepared to inaugurate in January an under-construction and long-awaited temple of the Hindu god Ram at the site of a demolished 16th-century Babri mosque in Ayodhya city in Uttar Pradesh state. The Babri Masjid mosque was destroyed by a Hindu mob with pickaxes and crowbars in December 1992, sparking massive Hindu-Muslim violence that left some 2,000 people dead, most of them Muslims. The Supreme Court’s verdict in 2019 allowed a temple to be built in place of the demolished mosque. Copyright © 2023 The Washington Times, LLC. Please read our comment policy before commenting.

      "Leaders from member countries, including President Joe Biden, are set to attend, along with about 1,200 CEOs and close to 30,000 delegates from governments and organizations.",
    content:
      "Presidents, prime ministers and prominent CEOs are gathering this week in San Francisco for two Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summits to forge and strengthen trade relationships among the 21 member countries — while local business groups hold piggy-back events and thousands of protesters prepare to disrupt the proceedings under a global spotlight. The APEC Economic Leaders’ Week, which runs through Friday, is being promoted as the largest gathering of world leaders in the city since 1945. Heads of state from member countries, including President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, are set to attend, with about 1,200 CEOs and nearly 30,000 delegates from governments and organizations expected for the summits. The influx, with security , will restrict movement within the city and is expected to snarl traffic. The complementary CEO Summit running Tuesday through Thursday will provide the Bay Area with rare opportunities to boost investment and trade between the region’s businesses and companies overseas, said Sean Randolph, senior director of the Bay Area Council Economic Institute. “We’ve been a major hub for the United States, a major connecting point with Asia for a long time,” Randolph said. “Our companies here invest heavily throughout the world, and there’s a lot of investment from companies around the world in the Bay Area and a large diplomatic presence. A lot of that presence is about technology and connecting those economies to our economy.” APEC countries — which range from Australia to Vietnam — make up almost 40% of the world’s population, nearly half of global trade, and are seven of the top U.S. trading partners, according to APEC. The San Jose metropolitan area exported $15 billion in goods to APEC countries last year, and the San Francisco metropolitan area exported $21 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. California exports about $125 billion in goods a year to APEC nations, and imports about $400 billion, according to the department. Established in 1989, APEC is dedicated to economic growth and regional political and business integration. Like other free-trade groups, it has become a flashpoint for protests against governments and powerful corporations. The CEO Summit features a who’s-who of controversial figures, from ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods, whom a congresswoman accused in 2021 of lying to Congress about climate science, to Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber, which agreed this month to from its drivers, to Peruvian President Dina Boluarte, whose administration was of human rights abuses, to President Yoon Suk-yeol of South Korea, who has attacked feminism and whose government is seeking to scrap its gender-equality ministry. The focus of APEC events “is entirely on enriching businesses within member countries,” said Nik Evasco of the No to APEC Coalition, a Bay Area-led alliance of several dozen activist groups. Thousands of protesters are expected to hit the streets in San Francisco for a major march Sunday, with demonstrations throughout the week. Activists are targeting the CEO Summit for another big protest Wednesday, Evasco said. “We’re really here to shut down the negotiations between the CEOs and the world leaders,” Evasco said. “Success for us is disrupting that conference between those leaders and CEOS to the point that it’s near chaos.” Evasco said activists will also protest APEC-adjacent meetings Monday and Tuesday in San Francisco for the , a Biden initiative to promote economic growth among 14 nations, most of them APEC members. Singmay Chou, an adjunct professor of business at San Jose State University, said over its three decades, APEC has boosted trade among members, especially between the U.S., China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, but that’s changing. “There has been a redirection of U.S. trade within APEC away from China and toward Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia,” Chou said. “The overall growth among APEC countries will likely decline as a percent of global trade. Countries outside of APEC, primarily India, and several countries of Africa, are among the world’s fastest-growing economies and more global trade will flow to those areas.” The gathering in San Francisco comes at a time of fraught geopolitical affairs, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the war between Hamas and Israel destabilizing APEC relationships, Chou said. Tighter relations between China and Russia could lead the U.S. and China to impose conflicting demands on APEC countries, creating a thorny problem for APEC, Chou said. A Wednesday meeting between presidents Biden and Xi could warm chilled relations between the two nations, which many businesses would welcome, Chou said. Several Bay Area tech executives are expected to speak at the CEO Summit, including Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta’s global affairs chief Nick Clegg, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Silicon Valley giants do substantial business with APEC nations, but relations are not universally smooth: China blocks Google, Facebook and Twitter, while other countries have pushed back against social media companies, with Malaysia this year threatening legal action against Meta over content it considered problematic, and Australia and Canada passing laws to make Google and Facebook pay for news on their sites. For Bay Area businesses, APEC and several spinoff gatherings will raise potential opportunities, said Russell Hancock, CEO Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a San Jose-based think tank. “The schmoozing will be terrific and they’ll meet a lot of people and it may lead to really productive talks about business deals,” Hancock said. For San Francisco — its downtown beset with blight, empty offices and vacant storefronts in the wake of the pandemic — APEC provides a potential opportunity to regain some of its shine as “a city just teeming with innovation,” Hancock said. Related Articles Among the satellite events officially recognized by APEC is the Bay Area Council’s APEC Meets California and Silicon Valley, running Monday to Friday and expected to draw hundreds of businesspeople, mostly local, to meet APEC delegates and at least two APEC-country ministers in and around informational sessions, the council’s Randolph said. Many sessions will showcase Silicon Valley’s leadership, in autonomous-vehicle technology, clean energy, biotechnology and health care, Randolph said. “It’s really to provide a platform that brings together visitors from APEC and leaders from the business community here that could lead to ongoing relationships,” Randolph said. Another officially recognized spin-off, called GENERATE and taking place Tuesday at Fort Mason, is also intended to leverage the presence of APEC delegates and U.S. and foreign officials, but for smaller companies. “Our goal is to bring the voices of small businesses and startups to this event,” said Minda Aguhob, executive director of The Co-Caring Initiative, the nonprofit putting on GENERATE. Organizers have been in touch with the White House and Philippine Consulate in San Francisco, and are hoping their representatives, and others, will join the hundreds of people expected to attend for a series of talks on subjects including small-business finance, education for entrepreneurs, climate change and women’s health care, Aguhob said. While startups are mostly absent from the main APEC lineup, one with its business office in Palo Alto will take a turn in the limelight, thanks to its fast-growing products and services dedicated to helping feed the planet by boosting the work of honeybees. Omer Davidi of Santa Cruz, CEO of BeeHero, is scheduled to appear with Gov. Gavin Newsom for a “fireside chat” Wednesday at the CEO Summit. BeeHero gives beekeepers “smart-hive” sensor technology to monitor bee colonies’ health using sensors to collect data on bees’ movements, wing-beat frequencies, and other behaviors, and sells data and consulting services to farmers to maximize crop pollination. Davidi believes BeeHero’s presence on this year’s CNBC “Disruptor 50” list of up-and-coming startups led to the APEC invitation. “It’s very exciting,” Davidi said. “We look forward to establishing more and more relationships with the group and seeing how our technology can support some of the initiatives and goals.”",

      "Back Print By Luis Andres Henao - Associated Press - Sunday, November 12, 2023 Marianne Williamson has kept barnstorming for months across America - to audiences large and small, from churches and colleges to spiritual centers and soup kitchens - in a demanding schedule of appearances in her second tenacious, against-the-odds run for the presidency. The bestselling spiritual author and one-time advisor to Oprah Winfrey didn’t make it to the 2020 primaries in a wide-open Democratic field. Now she is running against a sitting president from her own party, and the Democratic establishment has closed ranks behind Joe Biden . Even some of her most devoted followers doubt she can be elected. So why is Williamson even running? She says it’s the faith she has in herself and the American people. “The most important things you do in life, not because there’s guaranteed success on some external level, but because you feel in your heart it’s the right thing to do,” Williamson , 71, said during an interview in New York City. She admits it has been grueling at times - not just the punishing campaign schedule, but more so the emotional bruising from a barrage of unflattering characterizations. For her, it’s “the ultimate challenge to have tough skin, but a soft and open heart,” she said. But Williamson worries that negative perceptions detract from her policy positions, which include financial reparations for Black Americans and creation of a Department of Peace. PHOTOS: Bestselling spiritual author Marianne Williamson presses on with against-the-odds presidential run “What are the words they use? Wacky, kooky, crystal lady,” she said, listing the names she’s called. “People will take one line out of a book, completely out of context. That has certainly been done to me. Plus, you know, they lie.” Born in Houston to a Jewish family, Judaism remains her core belief, and she also embraces universal spiritual themes, like loving one another. Williamson came into the spotlight with her popular 1992 book, “A Return to Love.” Oprah, highlighting it on her own site, wrote: “I have never been more moved by a book.” Williamson , the author of more than a dozen titles and well-known for supporting LGBTQ people, retains a legion of dedicated fans. Millions buy her books, attend her lectures and engage with her on TikTok. “She is extremely sincere in her beliefs, wise in many ways even,” said Issac Bailey, a communications professor at Davidson College in North Carolina who has written about Williamson’s faith and politics. “But she also has a streak that takes her beyond the pale.” He pointed to her wariness and sharp criticism of government vaccine mandates that came up during her last campaign. She later said she supports vaccines. “I’m a socially middle of the road Jew who goes to the doctor,” she said. “I’m not a crystal lady. I understand how important science is.” Williamson entered politics with an unsuccessful independent congressional campaign in California in 2014, then broke onto the national stage two years later as a vocal supporter of Bernie Sanders’ failed presidential bid. In 2020, she entered the race herself. She acknowledges making what she calls “cringeworthy” comments back then, like how she would harness love to defeat former President Donald Trump. “Once they could be contextualized in a way that made me appear silly, there was almost no getting past the mockery,” she said. People may embrace quasi-spiritual language in their private lives, but if it’s from political candidates, it typically doesn’t play well on the campaign trail, said Galen Watts, a sociology and legal studies professor at the University of Waterloo in Canada. But this is not new territory for Williamson . For years, she has been under fire from intellectuals who call her theology too shallow, from politicians who mock her ideas, and more recently from some former campaign staff who say she’s irascible and is only trying to sell more books. She concedes that she probably swore more than she should have in her last campaign, but scoffs at the book-selling gibe. “The way to sell books is by going on a book tour, not a presidential campaign,” she said. “The way to sell books in my field is to never mention politics.” Some have questioned her political inexperience. But she dismisses that: “I reject the notion that only those whose careers have been ensconced in the car that drove us into this ditch are the only people we should consider qualified to drive us out of the ditch.” She announced her candidacy in February, and now is arguably the best-known Democrat still challenging Biden for the party’s 2024 presidential nomination. But recent polls show her running more than 60 percentage points behind. She is well-liked by many young people, including Jose Serna, a 21-year-old at Augustana University in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Serna hopes she stays in the race “because she is illuminating the ideas that young people care about” including Medicare for all, equitable wages and affordable housing. “While I do believe that it is unlikely that Marianne will win the nomination, it is not because of her policies,” he said, citing a common complaint by Williamson and her backers about a lack of media attention. Marie Griffith, a professor of women, gender and sexuality studies at Washington University in St. Louis, says there’s a practical reason why Williamson stands no chance of winning. “She has no connection that I know of to Democratic machine politics - meaning the people who raise all the money and make or break the political careers of those identifying as Democrats,” Griffith said. Williamson talks at times in religious and spiritual terms to describe America as a nation in need of confession and atonement. She worries about vast economic inequality and wants to declare a climate emergency. One of her signature policy proposals would have the government pay Black citizens reparations for centuries of enslavement and discrimination. She advocated for this in her 1997 book “The Healing of America.” Today, she proposes creating a council of Black academic, cultural and political leaders to disperse at least $1 trillion to Black Americans over two decades. Author and rabbi Jay Michaelson lauded Williamson for raising the issue before other political candidates, and for her work during the AIDS crisis, but in 2019 he wrote a scathing critique of her bid for president. He called her “selfish, deluded and dumb by denigrating science” and said she gives spiritually a bad name. Michaelson, in a recent interview, said he agreed with Williamson “that our spiritual commitments and our religious commitments should impact our political lives.” But he says she will remain a fringe candidate because some of her policy positions are too radical for many. “To say, ‘We need a politics of love’ without explaining what that is,” he said. “Or that we need a new paradigm, or that we need some kind of revolution - that doesn’t play on Main Street.” Williamson denies denigrating science and disputes broader criticisms of her campaign. “This idea that I am unserious - my campaign is the one talking about one in four Americans living with medical debt. My campaign is the one talking about the fact that the majority of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck,” she said. “My campaign is the most serious campaign.” ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

      "A proposed railway project that would bring a surge in the amount of oil transported along the Colorado River , but Colorado communities and lawmakers are now concerned about a different Utah project that would increase crude transports through the state. The proposed expansion of a rail transport facility could result in the shipping of a billion more gallons of oil each year on trains that run along the critical water source. At the Wildcat Loadout facility in northeastern Utah, waxy crude oil extracted from the Uinta Basin is transferred from trucks to trains that carry the substance east through Colorado to be refined on the Gulf Coast. If approved by , the expansion could more than triple the amount of oil transported from the facility from 1.3 million gallons per day to 4.2 million. Communities along the rail line, environmental groups and some members of Colorado’s congressional delegation about the potential environmental impacts from the increase, which adds up to just over 1 billion additional gallons transported each year. They worry the Colorado River and lands around the rail line would be at risk if a train derailed and the crude oil spilled. The Colorado River provides water for 40 million people, irrigates 5.5 million acres of agricultural lands, generates electric power and fuels recreation-based economies across the West. It also provides an important habitat for several endangered species. “It’s crazy to think a derailment wouldn’t happen,” said Jonathan Godes, a Glenwood Springs city councilman. Concerned groups and river advocates are urging the Bureau of Land Management to produce a full environmental impact statement — a detailed process they hope would include an examination of potential threats in Colorado from the expansion — instead of a more limited environmental analysis. “A train derailment that spills oil in the Colorado River’s headwaters would be disastrous to our state’s water supplies, wildlife habitat, and outdoor recreation assets, and the broader Colorado River Basin,” U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse wrote in a joint letter to the BLM about the project. “In addition, an accident on the train line further increases wildfire risk at a time when the West already faces historically dry conditions.” BLM spokeswoman Angela Hawkins wrote in an email that the agency was gathering information about the Wildcat Loadout expansion and had not yet made a decision about which type of environmental review to conduct. “As an early step in the environmental review process, the BLM will seek public feedback through a public scoping period,” she said. At normal outdoor temperatures, waxy crude oil extracted from the Uinta Basin forms a solid about the consistency of shoe polish. It has to be heated to be turned into a liquid for transport. In , the oil has formed into balls and solids that stuck to rocks or riverbeds. “Those tend to stick in the water for a very long time and would be very hard to clean up,” said with the Natural Resources Defense Council. The proposed is a separate project that would build an 88-mile rail spur connecting to the existing network. It would increase the amount of crude oil transported through Colorado by a factor of 10, according to projections, and an produced for that project described how a potential rail accident could spiral into a larger threat. “If an accident were to release crude oil near a waterway, crude oil could enter the waterway, which would affect water quality,” the 2021 analysis reads. “If the force of the accident were sufficient to ignite the crude oil, a fire could result that could remain confined to a single car or could surround other cars and cause them to rupture if the thermal protection on the other cars were breached or damaged. A fire that surrounds other cars could, in turn, cause a larger fire.” Axelrod said that while it considers the Wildcat Loadout expansion, the BLM likely will consider ordering a different federal agency to conduct a more thorough environmental impact statement for the Uinta Basin Railway Project. The order came in response to a lawsuit filed by five environmental groups and Eagle County. Progress is now halted on the Uinta Basin Railway while the federal Surface Transportation Board reworks its analysis to include potential impacts to the Colorado River and Colorado communities that would experience increased train traffic. “That case would give me pause about trying to get through this quickly, because it would be litigated,” Axelrod said. Many towns along the Colorado River and the Union Pacific railway rely on outdoor recreation and tourism, Eagle County Attorney Bryan Treu wrote in a letter to the BLM. “The Colorado River and its tributaries are not just the water source for tens of millions of people, businesses, and farms in the Western United States,” he wrote. “They are also the lifeblood of Colorado’s communities and ecosystems.” In recent years, Glenwood Springs has weathered recurring disasters: wildfire, mudslides and historic rainfall. A major oil spill or wildfire sparked by a train would be economically devastating, said Godes, the councilman. “Obviously, these companies are going to ship as much as they can,” Godes said. “You know, a lion is going to hunt. I can’t blame them. But it’s on us as a community and a state to say what is the right amount.”",

      "the Cambodian government reported that two people there , or H5N1 bird flu, after being exposed to infected poultry. For people, the risk of getting infected is low, but outbreaks in animals , wiping out chicken flocks and . The virus is devastating to poultry producers, who are forced to . A growing number of countries are starting to , while the United States and United Kingdom are still holding out because of uncertainties about immunization’s cost and effectiveness. Meanwhile, researchers in the UK have come up with another possible approach to protecting poultry flocks: gene editing. Scientists from the University of Edinburgh, Imperial College London, and the Pirbright Institute used to make the first chickens that are partially resistant to the virus. They published their results last week in the journal . Like tiny molecular scissors, Crispr allows scientists to make targeted cuts to an organism’s genetic code. The UK team used the technology to tweak a chicken gene that is responsible for producing the protein ANP32A. During infection, the bird flu virus takes over this protein to help make copies of itself. “All viruses are obligate parasites,” said Wendy Barclay, a study author and virologist at Imperial College London, during a press briefing on October 5. When viruses get inside a host cell, she said, “they hijack various proteins inside the cell to help themselves replicate.” In 2016, that influenza viruses use the ANP32A protein in this way. The researchers produced 10 chickens with this edited gene and exposed them to the H9N2 strain of bird flu, using a dose size that mimicked what animals would likely experience in the real world. They used this strain, rather than the more deadly H5N1, because it is the one chickens would most likely encounter during an outbreak. Only one of the 10 birds got infected, and the virus didn’t spread to other chickens. The team then exposed the gene-edited birds to an artificially high dose of the virus. This time, five out of 10 birds became infected, but the gene edit still provided some level of protection. The amount of virus found in the infected animals was much lower than the level typically detected among chickens that are ill with bird flu. The gene edit also helped limit the spread of the virus. Four ordinary chickens were placed in the same incubator with the gene-edited birds that had already been exposed to high levels of the virus. Out of the four, only one became infected. Researchers monitored the gene-edited birds over the course of two years and found that the gene changes had no adverse effects on their health or egg production. “This is showing a potential mechanism for reducing the susceptibility of chickens to avian flu,” says Carol Cardona, a veterinarian and professor of avian health at the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine, who wasn’t involved in the study. “But even if we protected every single chicken on the globe, flu wouldn’t go anywhere.” Avian influenza has been identified in more than 100 different species of birds. The fact that some breakthrough infections occurred means that the virus still has a chance to infect other birds, and could “escape” the vaccine’s effects by mutating away from using the ANP32A protein to reproduce. In fact, when the UK researchers took samples of the virus from the infected gene-edited chickens, they found some mutations in the part of the virus that this protein interacts with. “The flu virus replicates rapidly, and every time it enters a new host, there’s an opportunity for that virus to adapt and change,” Cardona says. During the press briefing, Barclay said those viral mutations didn’t make the chickens any sicker. The team also wanted to make sure those changes wouldn’t cause more severe infection in people, so they added the mutated viruses to human airway cells that had been cultivated in a dish. They found that the mutations didn’t help the virus grow in a way that would pose an increased risk to people. It’s also not known how the gene-edited chickens will fare against the much more aggressive bird flu strains such as H5N1, which weren’t tested in the study. Barclay said they chose H9N2, considered a low pathogenicity virus that causes little to no signs of disease, in part because it’s more common. Also, deliberately infecting chickens with H5N1 raises animal welfare concerns, since it causes serious illness and is often fatal. The authors identified two other related proteins, ANP32B and ANP32E, that they think would prevent virus replication. In chicken cells grown in the lab, they edited the genes that code for all three proteins and exposed them to the flu virus. The edits successfully blocked growth of the virus in the cells, but the researchers have not yet bred chickens with all three edits. Susan Lamont, an expert on poultry genetics at Iowa State University, says that making multiple genetic modifications could reduce the possibility that the viruses will escape. “When you start doing that, it really makes it much more difficult for the virus population to find its way around the resistance properties of that animal,” she says. But Brian Ladman, senior scientist at the University of Delaware Poultry Health System, says removing too many genes could be deleterious to the animals’ health. “These genes are there for a reason,” he says. For broiler chickens, which live only eight to 12 weeks before they are slaughtered, the health effects of gene editing may not have time to manifest during their lives, Ladman says. But laying chickens are kept commercially for two to three years. While the research is still in very early stages and isn’t ready to be deployed widely, Lamont says she can imagine that future poultry producers may combine vaccination against avian flu with gene editing to boost viral resistance. “This disease is so prevalent and so important that any strategies that we can bring together to help protect the health of the birds is, in my view, very good,” she says. Poultry producers already combine vaccination plus genetic selection—that is, choosing which chickens to breed based on certain traits—to prevent disease. Decades ago, scientists identified genetic variations that enhance resistance to the virus that causes Marek’s disease, a common and highly contagious illness that produces paralysis and tumors. Chicken producers began breeding birds with this trait while also vaccinating them against the disease. Lamont says this two-pronged approach is more protective than either on its own. The UK researchers say their gene-edited chickens are a proof of concept that shows a possible way to make chickens resistant to bird flu. “We’re not there yet,” Barclay said. “We would need more edits, more robust edits to really shut down the virus replication.” And in England at least, it will likely take some time for gene-edited chickens to make it to people’s plates. The government legalizing the commercial development of gene-edited foods, but a second vote is needed to allow farm animals with edited genomes. In the US, the first gene-edited food animal—a —was approved in 2022. The trait has been found to help cattle tolerate hot weather.",

      "Forty-eight years ago Friday, hurricane-force winds sunk the SS Edmund Fitzgerald, killing all 29 crew on board.",
    content: `. – It was Nov. 10, 1975, when an early winter storm complete with hurricane-force winds and dangerously-high waves sunk the SS Edmund Fitzgerald killing all 29 crew on board. Friday marks the 48-year anniversary of the sinking. Gordon Lightfoot's lyrics keep the Edmund Fitzgerald in the public conscience. "Superior, they said, never gives up her dead when the gales of November come early," Lightfoot wrote. This is one of many powerful verses in Lightfoot's 1976 Grammy-nominated hit "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald." Written mere months after the massive ore carrier vanished from radar screens, the song commemorates the controversial and somewhat mysterious sinking of the Fitzgerald. To most Midwesterners, this event is more than just a hit pop song. The final voyage of the Fitz began on Nov. 9, 1975. The 40-year veteran Capt. Ernest McSorley departed Superior, Wisconsin loaded with 26,000 tons of taconite pellets and a mission to deliver it to Detroit's Zug Island. The Fitz weighed 13,632 tons when empty. Not too far behind the Fitz was the Bernie Cooper-captained bulk carrier the SS Arthur M. Anderson. In response to the reports of a severe winter storm front on the horizon, McSorley and Cooper agreed to take a northerly path across the massive Canadian shores of Lake Superior over their radios. It didn't take long for the storm to make Lake Superior incredibly difficult to navigate. Low visibility caused by snow and high seas began to swallow the deck of the Fitz. "Anderson, this is the Fitzgerald. I have sustained some topside damage. I have a fence rail laid down, two vents lost or damaged, and a list. I'm checking down. Will you stay by me til I get to Whitefish?" radioed Capt. McSorley. Bernie Cooper agreed to tail McSorley and the Fitz to the shelter of Whitefish Point. The Fitz had also communicated with the saltwater vessel the Avafors at 5:30 p.m. "I have a bad list, lost both radars. And am taking heavy seas over the deck. One of the worst seas I've ever been in," radioed the Fitzgerald. The last communications between the Anderson and the Fitz came on Nov. 10, 1975, at about 7 p.m. At this point, the Anderson was trailing 10 miles behind the Fitz. "Fitzgerald, how are you making out with your problem?" asked Cooper. "We are holding our own," answered McSorely. This was the final radio transmission made by the SS Edmund Fitzgerald. There was no precise indication that the Fitz was sinking. It is estimated that it went down so quickly that Capt. McSorley wasn't even able to make a mayday call. The Fitzgerald had vanished and would never make it to safety. At 8:30 p.m. Bernie Cooper reported to the Coast Guard. "I am very concerned with the welfare of the steamer Edmund Fitzgerald. He was right in front of us experiencing a little difficulty. He was taking on a small amount of water and none of the upbound ships have passed him. I can see no lights as before, and I don't have him on radar. I just hope he didn't take a nose dive!" Cooper said. Capt. Cooper and the Arthur M. Anderson went back into the dangerous storm to search for the Fitz and its crew. They were unsuccessful. The Coast Guard initiated a search for the missing ship. On Nov. 14, 1975, a Navy plane with a magnetic anomaly detector located the wreck site. There it lay, 530 feet below the surface of Lake Superior, seemingly ripped in half, the bow sticking proudly upright. The rest of the story remains a Great Lakes legend to this day. The Fitz is the largest ship to sink on Lake Superior. The tragedy of the sinking was not the monetary loss of the cargo or even the loss of the liner itself. The tragedy was that 29 members of the crew lost their lives. The Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum in Whitefish Point, Michigan, hosts an annual memorial to mark this maritime tragedy. This year the 48th Annual Edmund Fitzgerald Memorial Event will be closed to the public but can be viewed on their website.`,
