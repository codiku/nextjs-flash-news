      'November 13, 2023 This article has been reviewed according to Science X\'s editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content\'s credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread by Aymen JAMLI A crowd has gathered to see off Rose, a loggerhead sea turtle, who labors across the Tunisian sand to rejoin the waters of the Mediterranean. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-1449240174198-2\'); }); For the last month, Rose has been recovering at the First Aid Sea Turtle Center in the coastal city of Sfax after she was ensnared in a fishing net . The facility, one of two in North Africa, is run by the EU-funded Life Med Turtles project, which looks after endangered species , such as the loggerhead, and aims to improve marine life protection by gathering data on their behavior. Since the center opened in 2021, nearly 80 turtles have been treated and returned to their natural environment, said its chief Imed Jribi. The project also aims to educate the local population in places like Sfax, which relies on fishing. "Before, we were ignorant," said 29-year-old local fisherman Hamadi Dahech, who brought Rose into the center after trapping her accidentally. "People ate them, used them for witchcraft, or as medicine and many other things. Today, thanks to (the center) raising awareness among fishermen, she has a better chance of survival at sea," Dahech said at Rose\'s release. "We use the turtles that arrive here for scientific research , for their protection as well as raising awareness," Jribi said. To highlight the natural wonders in the waters off Tunisia, the center opens to the general public on weekends. Malak Morali, a 30-year-old local who brought her two children to watch Rose\'s release, said her son loves the ocean-going creatures. "Every time he hears that there are turtles, he wants to come to take photos and learn new things," she said. Morali said that it was only thanks to the center that she learnt "that the meat is not edible". "We usually say that cooking it is good, but it is the opposite." The consumption of sea turtle meat is dangerous due to the high levels of pollution in the waters they inhabit. Toxins, such as mercury, build up in their liver and kidneys, posing a significant threat to human health. Besides the deadly metals, the turtles often eat floating waste. The creatures can "confuse plastic bags with jellyfish", said Hamed Mallat, a marine biologist. A 2015 study by the University of Queensland in Australia found that the majority of the world\'s sea turtle population was consuming plastic. Every year, around 10,000 loggerheads are caught by trawlers and in fishing nets in the waters off Tunisia, a potential death sentence for the turtles. Life Med Turtles estimates that around 70 percent of sea turtle deaths in the Mediterranean alone are caused by gillnets, a sort of large net suspended vertically in the water. Some, however, make it through alive and at the center in Sfax, it is often the fishermen themselves who bring in the injured turtles. As an acknowledgement of their help, the rescued animals are frequently named after the fishermen themselves. One of them, a frail baby turtle called Ayoub, was fed by caretakers with a syringe. As well as fishing, global warming poses an acute threat to the turtles by altering their sex ratio. According to the US National Ocean Service, if a turtle\'s egg incubates below 27.7 Celsius (81.9 degrees Fahrenheit), the hatchling will be male. But above 31 degrees Celsius the baby turtle will be female, putting the turtles at greater risk of extinction as fewer males are born. The rescue center in Sfax nonetheless has hope and is continuing its work to prevent the death of the species. Before releasing Rose, Jribi and Mallat attached a location tracker to her shell. They aim to analyze where Rose is most active, which could reveal more about her species\' migration and behavior. "She is the one who will protect the ecosystem at sea," said Rose\'s rescuer Dahech. © 2023 AFP',

    content:
      'Jailed Philippine human rights campaigner Leila de Lima has been granted bail, her lawyer said Monday, putting her a step closer to freedom after nearly seven years behind bars. De Lima, one of the most outspoken critics of former president Rodrigo Duterte and his deadly anti-drug war, was jailed on narcotics-related charges she says were fabricated to silence her. "This is a moment of triumphant joy and also thanksgiving," de Lima told reporters as she left the court surrounded by police officers and boarded a minibus to be taken back to prison. "I\'ve been praying so hard for this day to come. It\'s very painful to be jailed despite being innocent." Her lawyer, Filibon Tacardon, said de Lima "cried" when the decision was announced in the Manila court. "We expected the bail solely because of the merits of the case," Tacardon told reporters. "We believe that she\'s innocent -- we all believe that she\'s innocent and all these charges are trumped up." It was not immediately clear when she would walk free. Human Rights Watch welcomed the bail decision. "She never should have been unjustly prosecuted and detained by former President Rodrigo Duterte," deputy Asia director Bryony Lau said in a statement. Lau said Duterte\'s administration "concocted evidence and used the machinery of an abusive state to punish her for performing her duties as a senator and speaking out against the \'war on drugs\'." De Lima, 64, is accused of taking money from inmates inside the largest prison in the Philippines to allow them to sell drugs while she was justice minister from 2010 to 2015. Multiple witnesses, including prison gang bosses, died or recanted their testimonies, resulting in the dismissal of two of the three charges against de Lima. Since President Ferdinand Marcos came into office last June there have been renewed calls from human rights groups, foreign diplomats and politicians for de Lima\'s release. While in jail she has suffered various health problems, including a pelvic organ prolapse that required surgery. In October 2022, she was briefly taken hostage during an attempted breakout by three detained militants. Before her arrest on February 24, 2017, de Lima had spent a decade investigating "death squad" killings allegedly orchestrated by Duterte during his time as Davao City mayor and in the early days of his presidency. She conducted the probes while serving as the nation\'s human rights commissioner, and then from 2010 to 2015 as justice minister in the Aquino administration that preceded Duterte\'s rule. After winning a Senate seat in the 2016 elections that also swept populist Duterte to power, de Lima became one of the few opposition voices. Duterte then accused her of running a drug trafficking ring with criminals when she was justice secretary, forcing her from the Senate and into a jail cell. De Lima lost her bid for re-election in May 2022 after campaigning from behind bars. Duterte, who was constitutionally barred from seeking a second term as president, stepped down the following month. Throughout the proceedings, de Lima has insisted the charges against her had been trumped up in retaliation for going after Duterte and his drug war that killed thousands of people. The lawyer and mother of two has been held in a compound for high-profile detainees, rather than one of the Philippines\' notoriously overcrowded jails. pam/amj/mtp',

      "Hundreds of alleged members of the 'Ndrangheta -- Italy's most powerful organised crime group -- and their white-collar collaborators face sentencing this week following a historic, nearly three-year trial.",
    content:
      "Hundreds of alleged members of the 'Ndrangheta -- Italy's most powerful organised crime group -- and their white-collar collaborators face sentencing this week following a historic, nearly three-year trial. Prosecutors have asked for prison sentences totalling nearly 5,000 years for 322 defendants, who bear nicknames like \"The Wolf,\" \"Fatty,\" \"Sweetie,\" and \"Lamb Thigh\" and are accused of a dizzying array of offences. Based in the poor southern region of Calabria, the 'Ndrangheta is Italy's wealthiest and most powerful criminal organisation, which has a near-monopoly on the European cocaine trade. While it has stealthily expanded to now operate in more than 40 countries, back home the 'Ndrangheta has suffocated the local economy, infiltrated public institutions and terrorised its people for decades. Since January 2021, three judges in Calabria have heard thousands of hours of testimony -- including from dozens of mobsters turned state's witness -- about the Mancuso clan and its associates, which control the province of Vibo Valentia. \"It's an important trial because it targets one of the most powerful 'Ndrangheta families based in Calabria, with international ramifications,\" mafia expert Antonio Nicaso told AFP. The sentences could come this week. Held in a heavily secured courtroom bunker, the trial in Lamezia Terme represents Italy's largest \"maxi-trial\" in more than 30 years, involving vast numbers of defendants accused of being part of the same criminal conspiracy. Allegations include mafia association, attempted murder, drug trafficking, extortion, loan sharking, abuse of office and money laundering. The undisputed boss of the Vibo Valentia province, Luigi \"The Supreme\" Mancuso, 69, was cut from the defendants list last year to be tried separately. Mancuso spent 19 years in prison before going underground, but was captured as part of a massive police blitz in December 2019 in which more than 300 suspected mobsters were arrested. Prosecutors have asked for 30 years each for a dozen of Mancuso's top associates in charge of selecting targets for hits or extortions and maintaining relations with other mafias. But underscoring the 'Ndrangheta's success in infiltrating the legitimate economy, the defendants include public servants, professionals, mayors, and even a high-ranking police official. The highest-profile one is defence lawyer Giancarlo Pittelli, 70 -- a former MP and senator from ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party -- who faces 17 years for his alleged role as go-between with the world of politics, finance and illegal Masonic lodges. Some 67 defendants who were part of the original indictment have already been sentenced, after opting for a speedy trial. The trial's most colourful testimony came from more than 50 former mafia operatives turned state's witnesses -- including Luigi Mancuso's nephew, Emanuele. They recounted long-buried secrets, from weapons hidden in cemetery chapels and ambulances used to transport drugs, to municipal water supplies diverted to marijuana crops. Those who opposed the mafia discovered dead puppies, dolphins or goat heads on their doorsteps, torched cars or smashed up storefronts. Less lucky ones were beaten or shot -- or their bodies were never found. The courtroom is a former call centre converted to accommodate hundreds of lawyers, outfitted with more than 20 television screens piping in images of incarcerated defendants and informants by video link. Initially dismissed as mere livestock thieves, the 'Ndrangheta flourished under the radar for decades as authorities concentrated efforts against Costa Nostra, the Sicilian Mafia depicted in \"The Godfather\" movies. Today, experts estimate that the 'Ndrangheta, made up of about 150 Calabrian families and their associates, brings in more than 50 billion euros ($53 billion) annually around the world, from drug trafficking and usury to syphoning public funds and extortion, with illegal gains reinvested in the legitimate economy. Italy has made inroads in recent years, training police departments around the world to recognise the 'Ndrangheta on their turf -- and make arrests. But one crackdown is not likely to dramatically hinder the 'Ndrangheta, said Nicaso, citing the need for jobs, education and changing mentalities. \"That's what you need to challenge a criminal organisation.\" ams/ar/gv/yad",

    content:
      'Asian markets were mixed Monday ahead of key US inflation data later in the week, with traders still concerned the Federal Reserve could lift interest rates again. Decision-makers at the central bank lined up last week to warn that more tightening could be needed to bring prices under control, tempering optimism that the hiking cycle had come to an end. That sparked a sell-off in Asia on Friday, though a tech-led surge on Wall Street provided traders some support on Monday. But with focus firmly on the consumer price index and retail sales later in the week, gains were limited. "The forthcoming CPI report holds the potential to reintroduce the possibility of a rate hike," said Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management. "Presently, the market has largely discounted the likelihood of another increase. "While it was previously suggested that an aberrant inflation overshoot would be necessary to make the upcoming policy gathering next month uncertain, this week\'s data... may indicate that the risks are still leaning towards a sustained higher inflation plateau." Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai,Taipei and Jakarta were up but Seoul, Sydney, Mumbai, Bangkok, Manila and Wellington were in the red. Fears that global rates could remain elevated for an extended period were fanned by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, who on Friday forecast a resurgence of inflation. She also said officials would not start cutting rates for at least "the next couple of quarters". Expectations that US borrowing costs will not come down anytime soon boosted the dollar, with traders keeping an eye on its movement against the yen after Japanese authorities warned they could intervene to support their currency. However, Sonal Desai at Franklin Templeton said the Bank of Japan would likely shift from its ultra-loose monetary policy, giving the yen a much-needed lift. "We are going to see a change in policy in Japan and that is going to make the yen attractive," she told Bloomberg Television. "The BoJ will ultimately be pushed towards changing its own interest rate stance which will bring money back." Investors will also be watching a planned meeting between US President Joe Biden and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in San Francisco later in the week amid signs tensions were easing between the economic superpowers. Helen Zhu, of Nan Fung Trinity, told Bloomberg TV: "We are not expecting a love fest or any kind of fantastic outcome or permanent solution but there could be a graceful period of time going into the US election next year."

    content:
      'Thousands of people remained trapped in Gaza\'s largest hospital Monday, where evacuations have been hampered by fierce fighting between Israeli and Hamas forces. Conditions are worsening for hundreds of patients and thousands of others sheltering around Al-Shifa hospital -- which has become the focus in the five-week-old war. On Sunday, witnesses at the Gaza City hospital told AFP that "violent fighting" raged throughout the night. As the clatter of small arms fire and aerial bombardments echoed across the sprawling complex, doctors reported two babies died when power to their incubators was cut. Israel says that Hamas militants -- who killed 1,200 people during the October 7 attacks that sparked the war -- have deliberately based an operational headquarters at the facility and in an underground tunnel complex. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other UN agencies warned that as many as 3,000 patients and staff are sheltering inside without adequate fuel, water or food. "Regrettably, the hospital is not functioning as a hospital anymore," said WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, after making contact with on-the-ground staff. "It\'s been three days without electricity, without water," he said, describing the situation inside as "dire and perilous." Youssef Abu Rish, deputy health minister in the Hamas government, on Sunday said three more premature babies had died along with six other patients who had been in critical condition. "We fear the toll will rise further by morning," he said. Israel is facing intense international pressure to minimise civilian suffering amid a massive air and ground operation that Hamas authorities say has already killed 11,180 people, including 4,609 children. Foreign officials like EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell have urged Israel to show "maximum restraint", while condemning Hamas for using "hospitals and civilians as human shields." Israel\'s military said it would observe a "self-evacuation corridor" Monday, allowing people to move from Al-Shifa southward, but admitted the area was still the scene of "intense battles." The area of fighting "currently includes the area surrounding the Shifa hospital but not the hospital itself", a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces told AFP. Tens of thousands of Gazans have already fled from the north of the territory under Israeli orders. But it is unclear what, if any, provisions there would be for the sick and injured to be transported from Al-Shifa. The Israeli army also said its ground soldiers had hand-delivered 300 litres of fuel to the hospital "for urgent medical purposes". The military shared grainy night-time footage of combat troops hauling jerry cans, leaving a dozen or more outside a building. AFP was unable to independently verify the footage, or Israel\'s claim that Hamas "forbade the hospital from taking it." Only a handful of trucks carrying fuel had been let into Gaza since October 7, with Israel concerned fuel deliveries would be used by Hamas militants. Al-Shifa director Mohammad Abu Salmiya told journalists the Israeli claims were "lies". The 300 litres the army said had been delivered would power generators for "no more than quarter of an hour" anyway, Abu Salmiya said. Inside the hospital, AFP last week witnessed the sick and injured on gurneys that packed corridor walls. The courtyard of the emergency ward was dotted with people and piles of rubbish lay uncollected. Some of the thousands displaced by the fighting camped at the facility using make-shift kitchens and what few supplies they had. Across Gaza City at the Al-Quds hospital the picture was also said to be dire, with the Palestinian Red Crescent warning it was now out of service due to a lack of generator fuel. Twenty of Gaza\'s 36 hospitals are "no longer functioning", according to the UN\'s humanitarian agency. Almost 1.6 million people -- about two-thirds of Gaza\'s population -- have been internally displaced since October 7, according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA. Israel\'s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out calls for the ceasefire, saying Hamas must first release the estimated 240 hostages taken on October 7. Israelis are still stunned by the worst attack in their country\'s history and preoccupied with the fate of those still missing. A recent poll by the Israel Democracy Institute showed many Israelis back talks with Hamas to secure the release of hostages, but believe fighting should not be halted. Netanyahu told US media that "there could be" a deal to free the hostages, but stopped short of providing any details. "The less I say about it, the more I\'ll increase the chances that it materialises," he told NBC. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told MSNBC there has been "active negotiation" on a potential deal but kept mum on any details, while a Palestinian official in Gaza accused Israel of dragging its feet. "Netanyahu is responsible for the delay and obstacles in reaching a preliminary agreement on the release of several prisoners," the official told AFP on condition of anonymity. burs-arb/ser',

    content:
      'Seventeen-year-old Yavezi Alvarado wakes up early to get her backpack ready for school -- but she also has to prepare bottles for her one-year-old daughter, Kamila, who rides on the school bus with her. "When I wake up I have to get her Pampers ready, her wipes, her milk... And mostly clothes. Because, I mean, she gets dirty," said the Brownsville, Texas teen. The bus has safety seats for infants, who ride with their young mothers to Lincoln Park High School in a low-income Hispanic neighborhood just miles from the border with Mexico. The school takes girls and women aged 14 to 22 who are pregnant or have recently given birth. While they attend classes, a childcare center in the same school watches the little ones. Mothers can go there to nurse their babies whenever necessary. Knowing her daughter is nearby and is being well cared for makes a huge difference, Alvarado said. Texas is one of several conservative states that have banned abortion in the year and a half since the US Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade, the ruling that for a half-century had protected American women\'s abortion rights. That reversal has made child care an increasingly sensitive issue, though one that school officials are loath to discuss. In Texas, minors\' access to contraceptives requires authorization from an adult, and sex education is not mandatory in schools. Alvarado gets help from her mother, but some of her friends have faced discrimination in their old schools or rejection by family members and live with their child\'s father or other relatives. According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the birth rate among adolescents (aged 15 to 19) fell by three percent in 2022 compared to the previous year, and is a full 78 percent lower than the 1991 rate. But in Texas, the birth rate among young Hispanic women was 2.4 times higher than that of young white women, according to 2021 data from the NGO Healthy Futures of Texas. Teen pregnancies are not going to go away, said Cynthia Cardenas, principal of the all-girls school in Brownsville. "It\'s something that we should have a plan for." Inadequate access to healthcare, and low levels of education and family income can all contribute to high birth rates among teens and young women, according to the CDC. A few former Lincoln Park students have returned years later to bring their daughters -- now pregnant -- to school. "They need to be told, constantly reminded that being pregnant is not a disability, it\'s a condition, it\'s a nine-month condition... and you have that opportunity to be successful," Cardenas said. The school\'s daycare center now tends to 16 infants, its maximum capacity, with several others on a waiting list. Established in the 1990s, the school is one of a few of its kind in the US. The staff and teachers understand that students may miss the occasional checkup because of a doctor\'s appointment or after a bad night caring for their babies. "If this school didn\'t exist," said Cardenas, "my 53 students that are here now would potentially drop out of school." According to the NGO Child Trends, 53 percent of adolescent women who become mothers finish school, while 90 percent of those who are not mothers do so. Classes at Lincoln Park are in English but the population -- living just minutes from the Mexican border -- is mostly bilingual. Students who have to stay home after giving birth are visited by their teachers. And the school, which has state funding, has a specialized nurse on staff. "Here, they don\'t give me homework, I finish everything in school. And I spend more time with my daughter," said Lavezi Alvarado. Teachers treat their students with understanding. Science teacher GeorgeAna Wilson said that she sometimes sees a student struggling because "the baby was up all night long, the baby was sick." "And I say, \'You know what? Take a 10-minute power nap.\' That\'s something you wouldn\'t see in a normal school." "In regular schools they wouldn\'t understand your situation," said Milla Luevano, another 17-year-old student. "And here they do, they don\'t judge you, they help you, they communicate with you. And they understand your situation." Luevano, whose dream is to be a teacher, said she urges other young women who become pregnant to stay in school. "Don\'t give up, because that is something you are going to regret later on -- because you want a future," she said.

      "The United States will treat Russia as a full participant in this week's Asia-Pacific summit in San Francisco, despite US efforts to isolate Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, a senior official said Sunday. With a visit by President Vladimir Putin politically unthinkable, Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk will represent Russia at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit taking place between 11 and 17 November. \"He's being treated as the head of delegation, and he'll have the opportunity to participate fully in the week's events,\" Matt Murray, the US State Department official in charge of APEC, told AFP. Overchuk is under a variety of Western sanctions including from the European Union but not specifically under US sanctions, unlike much of Russia's top brass. \"We've been consistently saying all year long that we wanted to be good hosts of APEC,\" Murray said of the 21-member organization. \"But we were going to do so within the laws and regulations of the United States. And Russia's participation, obviously, has been shaped by that, because of the sanctions,\" he said. He acknowledged that Overchuk \"clearly won't be on the same level\" in diplomatic protocol as heads of state and government who are coming to APEC. The leaders include another frequent US adversary, Chinese President Xi Jinping, who will meet Wednesday with US President Joe Biden. The United States has voiced hope for stabilizing relations with China and finding limited areas of cooperation. In contrast, the United States has refused most contact with Russia since Putin defied US warnings and launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, spurring billions of dollars in US and other Western assistance to Kyiv. Putin faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court and sat out summits this year in South Africa and India -- both far friendlier to Russia than the United States -- although he recently traveled to China. The State Department last month publicly made clear it would not welcome Putin in San Francisco, leading Russia to reply that it was up to each APEC member to determine its own representation. sct/hg/st/sn/dva",

    content:
      "Fresno Pacific University’s East Hall freshman housing building is shown in this photo from the university. Fresno Pacific University is eliminating 16 programs in hope of realigning operations to enhance student success and financial health The university will no longer enroll students in 16 programs that have historically had low enrollment vs. costs, indicating lack of student interest. The 88 students affected—about 3% of the 2023-24 enrollment of 2,912—will be offered the classes and resources they need to complete their degrees on time. “We are in a dynamic and complex time in higher education,” said FPU President André Stephens, Ph.D. “A season that calls for courageous leadership to face the historic challenges and emerging opportunities before us. A season that calls us to renew our imagination and cast our vision to see the students of the Central Valley and beyond achieve their dreams. Our renewed focus must be on providing an excellent, holistic, biblically integrated education.” Decisions on which programs to suspend were informed by data and based on criteria developed in consultation with a committee of deans, faculty and staff, according to a news release. The board of trustees affirmed the plan at its meetings October 27-28. The affected programs are: Traditional undergraduate affected include: arts administration; biblical/theological studies; chemistry B.A. and B.S.; graphic design; mathematics B.A. and B.S.; applied mathematics; philosophy; political science; pre-law; Spanish and theater. The computer information systems bachelor’s degree completion program and graduate/seminary Master of Arts degrees in sports administration and theology, Old Testament are also affected. Courses in many of these areas will still be available to fulfill general education requirements and requirements in other majors, according to the release. Suspending these programs and reducing faculty in others will mean 11 faculty will end their employment with the university in June 2024. These positions represent about 10% of 109 regular faculty members. In addition, 12 faculty positions that are either term, currently open or will become open due to retirement will not be filled. All affected faculty have been notified and students in the programs are being contacted personally. “We realize these changes are painful and involve people who have dedicated their lives and careers to support FPU. We pray for the beloved colleagues who are affected by these changes. We are forever grateful for their kingdom service at Fresno Pacific and for the enduring contributions they have made to the lives of our students and alumni,” Stephens said. To streamline academic procedures, the university will consolidate its current five schools—the School of Business, the School of Education, the School of Natural Sciences, Fresno Pacific Biblical Seminary and the School of Humanities, Religion and Social Sciences—into two: a School of Arts and Sciences and a School of Graduate and Professional Studies. Many challenges to the university mirror those faced by other colleges and universities, according to the release, including Christian institutions in California and across the United States, such as smaller numbers of traditional-aged students, increased economic insecurity felt by individuals and families, lingering effects of the pandemic and increasing doubt by some about the value vs. cost of a four-year degree. Enrollment in the university’s bachelor’s degree completion programs has also been affected by years of declining enrollment in California community colleges. The academic realignment will help deal with a projected deficit as well as focus on areas of student interest, including bachelor’s degree completion programs in business management, liberal arts and criminology and master’s degree programs in teacher education, nursing and school psychology/counseling. The university will also be able to free up resources to improve the student experience and explore new academic programs. These changes also build on recent positive enrollment trends. After losing over 1,000 students since 2020, both traditional undergraduate and graduate enrollment rose in the fall of 2023. For traditional undergraduates—generally students 18-22 year of age who just graduated high school or are transferring from community college—the 10% increase was the first in 10 years. “FPU continues to look for ways to innovate and plan for what is next,” Stephens said. “I am convinced amidst the challenges we face that these steps move us closer to the goal of being a financially sustainable institution focused on the success of our students.” Fresno Pacific University is eliminating 16 programs in hope of (AP) — What's koi got to do with it?

        "Last month one of our journalists received an interesting email. A researcher had come across mention of a Guardian article, written by the journalist on a specific subject from a few years before. But the piece was proving elusive on our website and in search. Had the headline perhaps been changed since it was launched? Had it been removed intentionally from the website because of a problem we’d identified? Or had we been forced to take it down by the subject of the piece through legal means?",

        "Luckily the researcher had told us that they had carried out their research using ChatGPT. In response to being asked about articles on this subject, the AI had simply made some up. Its fluency, and the vast training data it is built on, meant that the existence of the invented piece even seemed believable to the person who absolutely hadn’t written it. Huge amounts have been written about generative AI’s tendency to manufacture facts and events. But this specific wrinkle – the invention of sources – is particularly troubling for trusted news organisations and journalists whose inclusion adds legitimacy and weight to a persuasively written fantasy. And for readers and the wider information ecosystem, it opens up whole new questions about whether citations can be trusted in any way, and could well feed conspiracy theories about the mysterious removal of articles on sensitive issues that never existed in the first place.",

        "Australia quietened the wild support from the 100,000-strong home crowd by dismissing their previously unbeaten opponents for 240 before Travis Head's sensational century meant they romped to victory with seven overs to spare. After their bowlers expertly took advantage of a slow pitch, Australia were themselves reduced to 47-3 as India hit back in an electric new-ball spell.But Head and Marnus Labuschagne calmly weathered the storm with a stand of 192 as Indian hope drifted away from the world's largest cricket stadium.Head was caught for 132 from 120 balls with just two runs needed, but Glenn Maxwell flogged the winning runs a ball later while Labuschagne ended 58 not out from 110.The superb victory means Australia extend their record as the most successful side in 50-over World Cup history and now sit four titles clear of the rest of the pack.It also caps a six-month period in which they beat India to win the World Test Championship and retained the Ashes in England.",

        "In 1960, space-mania was gripping the world and would-be astronauts were dreaming of their first forays skywards. But 28-year-old Captain Don Walsh had his sights set very much downwards. He was about to descend deeper than any human had ever ventured before. The US Navy had acquired a submersible called the bathyscaphe Trieste and Don, a submarine lieutenant, volunteered to join the project. But when he signed up for the mission, the deepest he'd been in a sub was just 100m down. He was in for a bit of a shock - the US Navy wanted him to dive more than a hundred times deeper. The plan was to head to the deepest place on the planet, the very bottom of the Mariana Trench, a narrow, underwater canyon, which lies in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Guam.",
